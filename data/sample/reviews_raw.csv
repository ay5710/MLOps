0219822,0689337,ThurstonHunger,Just say bonobo...,"I read the IMDB reviews on this two nights ago, and decided not to rent this film. But then as if by coincidence, the next night I noticed it was on cable currently, so I taped it.
And I'm glad I did.
It seems some reviewers lament the lack of a message in this, I can appreciate such weighty films, hey I enjoyed the ""Whale Rider,"" but such films often reduce down simply to hackneyed sententia. I'm kinda afraid life does as well...but this ain't the forum for that chat.
Charlie Kaufmann seems to specialize in *mixed* message films. I enjoy them as I enjoy a puzzle. They are thought-provoking both in theme and in details (don't know about you, but I had to look up Franz Kline...)
Other reviewers lament the onanism going on (or should that be down).  To me, ""Adaptation"" was a whole lot more masturbatory, this has an easier-to-follow plot. The humor rises more quickly to the surface...and yes I did chuckle at times.
No one so far has voiced concern over this being a film that reflects back from the start. It is done deftly; although I know some people dislike that as a device.
There are several nice film tricks. A circular beginning/ending, Robbins clearly being in a closed afterworld, and nods to other films...Bambi, Tarzan, Frankenstein, Sophie's Choice... ;> No, I'm forgetting another real one. I'm not that familiar with the director's MTV exploits, but I'll rent that collection sooner or later.
No one here yet has mentioned Young Frankenstein (which I see as more of a prototype than Pygmalion...or even Oedipus Rex.) But there are some serious questions being posed. Less these days than in the 70's do we get pitched an idyllic ideal; one wherein if man were stripped of his modern trappings, social strictures, political oppression and other garb, would we find a purer being? Isn't that also an element of Marx/Hegelism?
Kaufmann weaves a new sort of unibrow...uniting the high and the low.
There are other more universal moments here. Arquette struggling not to care what others think about her. Robbins trying to chose between the sweet girlfriend and the saucy seductress, between his heart and his...
Ahem, still there's much more here than what I fear is found in ""Me and Him."" Libido is a prime mover...whether subjugated or conjugal.
I'm having a hard time wrapping this up...is it a film that states that human nature is deceitful (all of four main characters are in at least one charade)?
Again, I'm glad I rented it. I've got to get better at cross-referencing other reviewers when reading posts here. I think Kaufmann is a very gifted, and very conflicted guy.

0219822,0689332,rosscinema,Odd little story from Kaufman,"This is further proof that writer Charlie Kaufman is probably the most unique writer in show business and he's developing into quite the cult figure. This odd story is about a woman named Lila (Patricia Arquette) who's body is covered with hair and at the age of 20 she retreats into the wilderness to hide and she writes nature books to make ends meet. But after some time she decides to leave and get electro-dialysis because she gets horny. Her friend hooks her up with a shy and repressed scientist named Nathan (Tim Robbins) and they hit it off. Then while on a nature walk they discover a man (Rhys Ifans) living in the wilderness who thinks he's an ape. They take him back to Nathan's lab where he is going to teach him to be human. Only Kaufman could come up with such a ridiculous story and make it redeemable. The film is directed by Michel Gondry who is known for directing several of Bjorks videos and he makes his feature film debut here. I think the film works because Kaufman makes sure the viewer is not to take this seriously but at the same time the humor is not presented in an over the top way like some cheap attempt at laughs. The humor is more dry witted and it reminded me a little of something Albert Brooks might have thought of. Another thing I enjoyed was the performance of Arquette. She's the core of this film and it should remind everyone that she is able to carry a film by herself and that she's a very underrated actress. I've always been a big fan of hers and she's just not used in films enough. She does appear nude but she seems fine with it and she should, she looks great. The film wants to ask the question about sex and the difference between humans and animals and the environment we are all brought up in. When the film was over I wasn't sure what to make of it but once I found out that Charlie Kaufman wrote the script an immediate smile came across my face. Knowing he was behind this odd comedy seems to make all the sense in the world!",6.0,2003-06-24,29,12,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0
0219822,0689331,TxCracker,The question on all of our minds:,"After perusing the other viewers' comments on this site and noting the plethora of pertinent sociological questions that arise from the viewing of this obviously intellectual piece of cinematography, I can't help but notice that the most obvious question of all has not yet been touched upon, therefore, I will ask it now.
If you were locked in a room with Patricia Arquette and an electric grooming shear, would you shave her body before making love to her?
Maybe the reason this question has not yet been asked is because the answer is so obvious it pretty much goes without saying. That answer is, of course, no. If you were to buzz-cut Ms. Arquette's body with such a tool, you would, without any doubt, leave a stubble that would be rough and scratchy, causing you so much discomfort during the act of intercourse that the whole experience would inevitably become somewhat unpleasant, relatively speaking.
Leaving her hairy, on the other hand, would give you the sensation that you were rolling around with a large, fluffy dog...a feeling which could only add a new measure of pleasure to the whole coital experience. This should not be construed as bestiality, being that the ""fluffy-dog"" sense of pleasure would be separate from the ""doing Patricia"" feeling of prurient ecstasy, which means the whole scenario could be pulled off guilt-free.
That would be superb, especially for me, being that I have been totally hot for this particular actress ever since I saw her in True Romance. I would be happy to be in bed with her even if she was a toothless quadruple-amputee covered with hair from her head all the way down to her...uh, never mind.",7.0,2003-06-08,5,3,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0
0219822,0689296,shades033,A bizarre comedy from the warped mind of Charlie Kaufman,"The latest movie from the warped mind of Being John Malkovich writer Charlie Kaufman is a romantic comedy, exploring the relationships between four individuals brought together by a series of tentative bonds.
The first character, introduced in a series of flashbacks, is Lila (Patricia Arquette), a hirsute girl who becomes an outcast from society due to her fur-covered body. She decides to live in the forest and become a nature writer, but eventually, she gets horny, so her electrolysist (played by Rosie Perez) sets her up with Dr. Nathan Bronfman, an anal and neurotic psychologist, played by Tim Robbins. Bronfman has his own set of issues after being raised by strict disciplinarian parents, and it's not surprising that he's a 35-year-old virgin, considering that his main area of study is trying to teach lab mice table manners. The two quickly fall in love and on a nature trip, they come across a man who has been raised in the wilds, not by a monkey, but by his human father who thinks that he is a monkey. This monkey man, played by Rhys Ifans, brings out Lila's more animalistic urges, but Nathan thinks that this is the key for taking his research to the next step. The newly dubbed ""Puff"" allows himself to be conditioned by Nathan, trying to please his newfound ""father"", by learning and acting more human.
Relative newcomer, Miranda Otto, plays Gabrielle, Nathan's manipulative ""French"" lab assistant, playing with the doctor's feelings to get whatever she wants from him. When Nathan finds out Lila's hairy secret, it horrifies him, driving him into Gabrielle's arms and creating a bizarre love rectangle between the four.
Kaufman once again gets a chance to see how far he can go with a number of strange premises and try to tie them together into a cohesive story. This time around, he is working with another video director making his first feature length film in Michel Gandry.
Frankly, Human Nature only has one or two jokes-neither as original as a portal into the head of John Malkovich-but they're funny enough to be stretched out and provide humorous fodder for the entire movie. It does take a little while to warm up to these characters and the situation though. Early in the movie, when a naked and hairy Lila starts parading through the forest singing a song that could have come right out of Disney's ""Song of the South"", you expect a very long and painful movie. But it gets better, and clearly, Rhys Ifans steals the movie, much like he did as Hugh Grant's roommate in Notting Hill. Some of the funnier scenes involve Puff's ""training"" to be more human, and the set-up just gets more and more outlandish. At one point, he is taught how to behave at the opera with a full opera box set constructed inside his cage. Imagine Gene Wilder and Peter Boyle singing ""Puttin' on the Ritz"" in Young Frankenstein to get some idea how funny this situation becomes as it progresses. Ifans alternates between being highly cultured and refined and being a horny, sex-crazed animal. This leads to all sorts of insane situations, where he tries but fails to control his urges, at one point humping a waitress in a classy restaurant. Eventually, he goes on a lecture tour, and the animalistic lovemaking of Nathan and Gabrielle in the next room, drives Puff to a lecherous life seeking out prostitutes. This allows Ifans to show off a darker side to the character, and he beautifully captures the pain suffered by a man-animal that can't decide which he would rather be. The characters are similar archetypes to those found in Being John Malkovich, as Tim Robbins plays John Cusack's hapless schmuck, Otto plays the Catherine Keener bitchy other woman role, and Arquette is the frumpy, spurned woman. Most of the second half of the movie shows how the four characters play a series of human mind games, as they try to feed their animal urges.
Tim Robbins plays his character a bit subtler then some of his past roles, but it works for the character. One of the other amusing schticks involves Nathan debunking his own shrink's theories on his problems--surely his chosen field of study couldn't have anything to do with his strict upbringing. His reaction to finding out that his parents have adopted a polite and well-mannered six-year-old is priceless.
It's fairly obvious that Otto is one of Australia's latest Nicole Kidman clones, as she has a similar mix of beauty and range of demeanor, being sweet one moment and sassy the next. While Gabrielle is a fairly minor role compared to the others, her next appearance will be in the second chapter of The Lord of the Rings.
Patricia Arquette is the weakest link in this equation. (Or is she the missing link?) She spends much of the movie naked or semi-clothed, but doing everything possible to be as unattractive and as unsexy as possible. If she isn't covered in hair from literally from head to toe, she is shaving her body hair, or she is bald, wearing a bad wig and acting psychotic. The concept of a hair-covered woman is a creep enough concept without Arquette's over-the-top performance.
The movie isn't as stylish as some of director Michel Gandry's videos, although the forest scenes hark back to one of his earliest works, which irony of ironies, was on Bjork's first video for the song, ""Human Behavior"".
Overall, Human Nature is a bizarre little movie that gets funnier as it goes along. The laughs come slow at first, but once Rhys Ifans takes center stage, the laughs are regular and hearty. It is a terrific exploration of what it is to be human and what it is to be an animal, and how hard it sometimes is to make the two ends meet. That said, if you're expecting this to be exactly like Being John Malkovich, then you may be disappointed, as this is an animal of another species.

0219822,0689320,room102,See it for Rhys Ifans,"In terms of release dates, Human Nature (2001) has got to be one of the weirdest movies I've encountered: It premiered in Cannes 2001, but is getting released only now (May 2002) in the states (limited release) and Europe, in a painfully slow manner - See Release Dates.
Nice movie about the human nature, as its title suggests. It presents some interesting aspects about the human society and the rules we make. Although I expected it to be a little more ""deep"" and present some more fundamental and philosophical ideas, it's very enjoyable and extremely funny at times.
The 4 leading actors are great, especially Rhys Ifans and Patricia Arquette (how brave!); Who knew she's got such a lovely singing voice, too?
This is Michel Gondry's first feature. Gondry is a French video-clips director, known for his excellent work on such music videos as Massive Attack's ""Protection""; Chemical Brothers' ""Let forever be""; Foo Fighters' ""Everlong""; Daft Punk's ""Around the World""; and Bjork's ""Joga"", ""Bachelorette"", ""Hyperballad"", ""Isobel"", ""Army of me"" and ""Human Behaviour"".

At first I thought it'll be GREAT, 'cause Charlie Kaufman is the author of the screenplay. I think, that Charlie Kaufman is the greatest author of our times. Being John Malkovich  (1999), Adaptation (2002) and  Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002), I can watch these films dozens of times and they became each time more interesting. BUT this movie is a piece of disappointment. IMHO M. Gondry is not the right man to work with screenplays like that.
It's pity that he gonna do ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind""( which is the great script by the way). But I hope for the best. You know sometimes the script makes the movie and not the director. But with the Human Nature (2001) it's not the case definitely.",4.0,2003-03-20,6,5,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0

The movie is actually good, it just has a few flaws, that you might see when you watch it for the first time. And therefor maybe you should only watch it once and stay onto the good feelings you had for this movie.
It is greatly acted and the jokes hit the mark. Cleverly written and nicely directed (by Mr. Gondry who I adore very much), this has a very unique story to it.

0219822,2506132,dierregi,Hirsute lady and ape boyfriend drifting in nature & society,"The story goes as follows: a beautiful hirsute blonde, named Lila and played by Arquette, upset by her work experience in a circus' freak show, runs away from society and becomes a famous writer. However, due to sexual urges, she decides to undergo painful (and extremely lengthy) electrolysis on her whole body, to find a sexual partner.
During what one can only imagine as extremely tedious and painful epilation sessions, her beautician mentions a screwed-up scientist, who no woman in her right mind could possibly find attractive. For mysterious reasons, Lila is intrigued, met him and falls in love. Unfortunately, electrolysis having not worked its miracles yet, Lila must continue shaving her body regularly. She is keeping her condition a secret and when she moves in with scientist boyfriend Nathan – played by an unbearable Tim Robbins – her secret becomes hard to keep.
At this stage, the weird couple runs into a wild ape-man (named Puff) and they decide to take him back to Nathan's lab and train him to behave. It must be noted that the main experiment carried out by Nathan was teaching rats to use the correct fork while eating sitting at a table. Honestly, you cannot make this stuff up
After some idiotic antics involving a slutty lab assistant, Lila gets dumped because her body hair is still not completely gone. So she kidnaps Puff and moves back into the forest, to live naked and happily hereafter with the ape-man.
Unfortunately Nathan decides he wants Lila back, despite having moved in with the slutty lab assistant. Tragedy ensues, but honestly who cares? Not a single one of these characters has any lovable (or believable) feature. Starting from the hairy Lila (why would any actress play this part is beyond my understanding), to the sadistic Nathan who wants to teach rats how to use forks, not to mention ape-man Rhys Ifans, afflicted by serious masturbatory problems.
The last - but foremost - question I have is the same asked by another reviewer: how does stuff like this get financed? Seriously, who wants to invest in this type of material?",1.0,2011-10-21,7,10,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0
0219822,0689299,Eli-18,it's nice to see a movie that raises philosophical questions,"'Human Nature' will inevitably be reviewed in comparison to 'Being John Malkovich', and the comments will be along the lines of 'less coherent', 'not likely to be as commercially successful', etc.  But should these be reasons to NOT see this movie?  Only if you want to miss the most intelligent movie to come out since BJM.  Forget 'A Beautiful Mind', which gives the appearance of intelligence by flaunting pseudo-guru math, but was just another sappy tale of 'the triumph of the human spirit'.
What makes 'Human Nature' and BJM a cut above the usual cinema drivel, is that they actually attempt to get into some serious philosophical issues. BJM delves into personal identity, while 'Human Nature' digs even deeper into the realm of our underlying... human nature.  What makes human nature any better than animal nature?  civilization?  language? manners?  And do these distinctly human features actually make us better, or just different, or different in a bad way... i.e. by making us lead dual lives, tearing our originally united being into inharmonious halves (subjective/objective)? And can we simply unite our duplicitousness by forgetting language, civilization, and manners... by returning to nature? Or, with a philosopher who gets an intensional nod in 'Human Nature', Wittgenstein, are we stuck in language, forever banished from the garden of eden?
This movie raised all of these questions, and more, for me... which is what I expect out of a good movie: not only does it entertain us, but it invites us to join in the entertaining.  By posing these questions, it challenges us to answer them, and to ask our own questions of it... which means that we have to see it again in order for it to continue the dialogue.  Now that's what I call interactive movie-going.  Philosophy has started some great stuff in history: religion, government, science.  So I think that's its not asking too much for movies to engage in philosophical debates and trying to include the audience, rather than thinking of the audience as fodder for the box office.",10.0,2002-04-13,38,8,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0
0219822,1315523,shanejamesbordas,Approach With Caution,"The biggest question one should ask in regards to this work is: how does stuff like this get made - who finances it? Although boasting an impressive cast and a script by Charlie Kaufmann, the result is a chaotic mess.
He may present us with interesting and strangely twisting scripts but somehow Kaufmann's work always leaves me less than fulfilled. Maybe it's because he lets too many thoughts come to the surface and then stray as he buries each under a morass of themes that all peter out long before the end. Work like this mostly comes across as a poor man's Preston Sturges; 'Miracle Of Morgan's Creek' it ain't.
Still, there are some moments of interest and it is intriguing to see an actress as attractive as Arquette defile her body image (including a very young Hillary Duff playing Arquette's character in flashback) so thoroughly as she does here. Yet there seems precious little insight or depth of ideology and Gondry's pop-promo directorial style helps matters little.
This is certainly a curiosity for fans of Kaufmann's writing but surely even the most die-hard admirer would have to admit to its many failings. Approach with caution.",2.0,2006-03-14,5,8,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0
0219822,0689328,mesmorizedmind,Nature Is Entertaining.,"Spoilers herein.

I've been watching a lot of movies and this movie is kind of like a snack in between the really hard hitting movies. As that, it's really entertaining, at times insightful, and fun to watch. Some people may have gone into watching this expecting a straight comedy, and perhaps that is the reason they were disappointed. The movie is satiric, and only at certain times is the comedy blatant and obvious (some people call this gross-out humor). I found the idea of Arquette's character Lila having hair all over her body as a bit uncouth, but the filmmakers are trying to make a point about the superficialities that is part of being human.

Acknowledging the title, I expected a mock of what we humans hold dear as our essence, and I got just that. The movie should not be discredited because the philosophical aspect of nature versus nurture is on the light side. I think Human Nature has some good insights that everyone can walk away with. As humans in a civilized society, we have to conform to the norm and follow rules. We have to restrain our hormonal pressures for sex and the like. Isn't it argued by some that the sole purpose of life is to reproduce? That idea is a bit crude and cold, and most of us don't like to think of it like that.

We used to be in touch with nature when we were first born, but after being indoctrinated into societal culture and behavior, we lost our nature. This dehumanization of our essence is essentially what we hold to be human, as ironic as that is. Man is a rational animal as Aristotle said. Would we be rational if weren't taught to be? Are we at all times rational in this civilized society? Aren't people still fighting over trivial things? Are we any smarter now than we were two thousand years ago? Although not explicitly in the movie, these sorts of thoughts is what the movie is essentially bringing up.

One of the funniest scenes in the movie was when Puff (Rhys Ifans) is shown a slide of a naked woman on a projector and he instinctively lunges at the picture trying to 'get some.' I am reminded of a similar scene, with different ends, in Clockwork Orange. Nathan (Tim Robbins) has to shock him several times before he learns to contain his sexual urges. I found all of the scenes trying to teach Puff to be a sophisticated person hilarious, including the scene where he whispers to a manakin from a fake balcony watching a non-existent opera. Miranda Otto playing the assistant of Nathan, Gabrielle, was funny with her fake French accent and mannerisms.

Nathan's parents were equally funny teaching their adopted six-year old son Wayne table manners. At one point, Nathan says, ""Mother please tell Wayne not to hit on my girlfriend."" I liked when Puff's father goes berserk and ape-like when he sees the newspaper headlines saying ""Kennedy Assassinated."" I found it interesting to see Nathan sitting in what we assume is purgatory telling his story and asking if he is going to heaven or hell, or if he would have to tell his tale again. *SPOILER - The ending is hilarious when Puff gets together with Gabrielle after pretending to go back to nature. /*SPOILER

Overall, this is a good movie. Human Nature is funny, original, and has a message to give to the viewers. The film manages to pack all of this in 96 minutes, good for those of you with short attention spans. Forget Charlie Kaufman wrote the screenplay because that will create expectations too big for this movie to handle. This is a sleeper that everyone should check out.",,2003-04-15,9,3,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0
0219822,3685913,sol-,Nature or Nurture,"A deceased behavioural scientist waiting to enter heaven, a woman with body hair issues and a man raised as an ape each tell separate panels how their lives came to overlap in this offbeat comedy written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by Michel Gondry - the team behind 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'. The drama here is not as touching as in their latter collaboration, but the comedy side of 'Human Nature' is just as quirky with eccentricities ranging from laboratory mice who have been taught how to use cutlery to Rhys Ifans mixing up dining manners with his baser human urges. The title of the film is somewhat ironic as the film explores the effects of conditioning - as well as the side effects of repressing what comes naturally. It is not an entirely realistic story as the scientist, played by Tim Robbins, kidnaps a feral Rhys Ifans, found in the woods, and raises him in a glass cage in his laboratory like a guinea pig, but then again, from the gigantic illuminated signs that Robbins uses to teach him how to talk to politely (!) to the somewhat miniature furniture that he gradually crowds his glass cage with, outrageousness seems to be what Kaufman and Gondry are most acutely interested in. Plus, of course, prodding questions of just how much sense conditioning makes and whether we are in life ultimately driven by sexual desires above all else.",7.0,2017-04-16,1,1,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0
0219822,1540720,Quinoa1984,"Charlie Kaufman does the Wild Child, in one of the oddest comedies in recent years","Unlike the other works from Charlie Kaufman- Being John Malkovich, Adaptation and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind- Human Nature doesn't leave the sort of unbelievable cinematic residue that stays for days and week and even years afterward. It's a work that is low-key even as it's insanely zany in spurts and totally tuned into a comedic frequency that only works for the casual viewer sometimes. But even a lesser work from the likes of Michel Gondry and Kaufman registers higher in a way that comedies with lower ambitions couldn't dream to aspire to. It has some conventionality to it, with its love triangle between Dr. Nathan Bronfman (Tim Robbins), Lila (Patricia Arquette), and Gabrielle (Miranda Otto) that ends up tearing apart the characters to question who they are (aside from Gabrielle). Yet that's not really totally at concern, though it probably has somewhere to figure into the whole idea of what makes for truth in human nature. One might argue, after seeing the film, it has something to do with individualism...actually, if we go by Kaufman's interpretation, it has to do with orgasms.
Told in quasi-Rashomon style (with the law and the afterlife, as in Rashomon, figuring into Human Nature as well), Bronfman has an interest in teaching mice table manners when we first meet him (one of the film's funniest recurring images/scenes), and gets set up on a date with Lila, who's a writer of nature stories (from personal experience, due to an abnormal hair condition as a child she decides to live in the wild after an unsuccessful stint at a side-show). She decides to conform for him, hiding the fact that she's a hairy ""ape"" from the wild, as he hides his compulsion for manners and proper behavior. Enter in ""Puff"" (Rhys Ifans, in one of his funniest roles/performances yet), who gets that name by Gabrielle, Nathan's assistant at work, and an adoptive mother to Nathan being adoptive father. Now it will be time to really go further with Nathan's research- to teach one who's been in the wild always to be a proper, educated human. This proves to be a challenge, as Puff can't resist the urge to hump whenever aroused, and is around the sexual explosion that erupts between Nathan and Gabrielle- the love triangle that unfolds that may spell as foreshadowing for Puff later on in the story...
And so on. You might get just the slight sense- scratch that, overwhelming impression- that this is not you're average tale of what it means to be an ape-man and become 'civlized'. It's a whacked-out comedy of manners and sexuality, where one's own soul becomes more of a question then what is really meant to be proper or what not. Actually, there is some interest in how Nathan figures into this as well- he's the least human of all, at least for the most part, as he loses himself in his pursuit of science, with Lila losing hers alongside. So Kaufman does end up working some very interesting characters here, and the situations and little notes that pop up are about as irreverent as he's ever done. The problem is it ends up un-even too: little things are left un-checked, as to Gabrielle possibly not being really French (it's put in as a possible note of her being untruthful as well, but it's never addressed again, or her motives of anything, even as Otto plays the character well enough), or the psychology that emerges from Puff himself. Does he just want to ""have some of that"" as he says to the committee, or does he get too adjusted to his surroundings.
However what holes or problems might lie in the screenplay, there's no denying the bright strengths just in general working in Human Nature. Who would think up such a strange concept, leaping bravely off of Truffaut's Wild Child into a sort of common theme in Kaufman's work so far? Kaufman would, especially as it's part of the need to feel like someone else, or what it must be to try to be something one can't really be through insecurities and troubles in dealing with reality and surroundings. I would imagine that Kaufman had a lot of fun churning this one out, possibly even thinking it might be improbable it might even get made. Luckily, it's directed by Gondry with his mix of fantastical visual energy and a real sense of humility with the absurd material. It doesn't have the same power as in his best work either, but as a first feature film it could've been a lesser endeavor too. Human Nature ends on an (ironically?) unique ending, where Puff does what we'd expect him to do, but then maybe not, and it caps off what has led up to it- a weird little ball of comic-curiosity that should please fans of Robbins (very funny in his awkward doctor character), Arquette, and especially Ifans.",7.0,2006-12-09,1,1,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0

I love this movie. I love how it translates the dry language psychological philosophy into an entertaining movie that is both emotional heavy and light heartedly funny. Rhys Ifans is absolutely wonderful in his portayal of the apotheosis of the destructive nature of language on human emotion.  As with adaptation I just can't say enough about this movie.

0219822,0689327,FairyMail,A must-see for Americans,"There are many different kinds of movies. This is one of a rare species: a film with a message. Other people might hear different morals when watching it, or none at all, which is okay, too. But to me, Charlie Kaufman wants to tell us ""deprive an adolescent of his right to a natural sexual development and you create a violent outburst"".
Director Michel Gondry presents you a satire. The comedic element comes from grotesque, which is a relief after the all too juvenile teen movies that pathetically try to generate laughter by gross embarrassment and over-emphasized sounds of rearward body functions.
Instead of telling the story of average parents struggling to deal with their teenage son, you will find a) a woman with excessive body hair (in my view representing all your everyday discontent with your true self), and b) a man with an obsessive compulsion to demand perfect table manners (which of course stands for the misuse of parental power to force his unfounded views onto his ""son"")
The adolescent in this film being troubled by his sexual awakening is not the usual cool, hip, handsome high-school kid that all the real cool, hip,... okay-looking high-school-kids don't want to identify with anyway. It's Puff (Rhys Ifans), a young man who was raised by a deranged father to believe that he is an ape. This brings him in a situation not totally unlike that of a (human) teenager: somehow like the other humans, but being told that he's all weird and that everything he knows is suddenly wrong and bad. Eager to learn and please, he tries his best to conform, but to ""control"", that is, to ignore and deny his sexual curiosity, is just asking too much and he is forced to resort to deception.
It always amazes me how we Americans keep wondering why we have about 200x more shooting deaths than (other) civilized countries. One reason can be seen in the ratings for this particular film. Europe: around 12 (France: PG), USA: R, for it's hard to spot nudity. This is ironic confirmation of what the film is trying to draw attention to: by demonizing Puff's sexuality and using violence to suppress it, both Nathan and Lila become guilty of creating violence in turn.
For viewers who find this to be what this movie is about, I strongly recommend Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine (Title 0310793 here on IMDB.com) only it is not so funny, because it's a documentary.",,2003-03-05,16,14,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0
0219822,3457074,RavenGlamDVDCollector,"bit hairy, but has an instant charm","The trailer of this one was mostly off-putting. It showed possibilities, but Patricia Arquette in that awful wig? I watched it again and again, and focused on the positive, but the uncertainty made me wait (+ the option I found was hellishly expensive) but the research on IMDb showed a considerable interest in this movie, including the kid on the board post whose Mommy forbid seeing it.
A more affordable British option became available, but I still kept holding back, especially after GOODBYE, LOVER, an earlier DVD purchase, drew a less-than-thrilled-with-Patricia response. Yet, it is a RavenGlam idiom here in ElectricLadyLand, ""she's an Arquette"", yes, glamor runs in that bloodline. So, I finally took the chance. When it came to watching, I was just prepared, do not expect too much, you are bound to be disappointed.
I was very quickly nicely surprised. This was very well done. The al fresco nudist scene with Patricia singing that bit about all the hair and the cuddly old bear while the forest denizens watch on, that is just movie magic, admittedly very, very off-beat, I am a total purist at heart and wouldn't want the cast of 90210 or MELROSE PLACE to sprout hair, hair everywhere, but this sequence was so innocent and charming...
Okay, there are bits in the movie that needed a rethink. And Nathan was so dull, why he had Gabrielle interested in him as well, I fail to understand. She wasn't a gold-digger, he surely wasn't even rich, what did he have to offer? His nice personality??? Miranda Otto is another very big plus point of this movie. She played her sexy faux French chick to perfection. Okay, I fail to understand why she and Puff unites at the end, she is supposed to be a bad girl. If it's for sex, it's not for some devious reason. Anyway, love Miranda's bedroom lair and her nice long legs. Gee, for those of you who misunderstood, Gabrielle knew exactly how hot she was, and just pretended to feel ordinary to draw a deluge of compliments from Nathan.
Loved her whirlwind clean-up act. Sounds only, but imagine it as a cartoon.
Movie starts off great, fails to maintain that level. It is grossly uneven. But I am very glad I bought it. With all its faults, it is well worth watching. I'd just not have brought death into a comedic plot. Takes the fun out of it.

Patricia Arquette plays a hirsute freak-show act who abandons city life for the feral way in the woods as a best selling writer of the nature experience, but when that all becomes too much for her and her hormones introduce to her lust, she opts for human life - painful electrolysis included - to meet and live with stuffy etiquette scientist Tim Robbins whose own pet project is the taming and re-humanizing of Rhys Ifans, raised in the woods with chimps.
The subsequent tale follows Ifans long and torturous education to being a gentleman, with some comedic humping when he is remotely confronted by the sight of any female. This plays smoothly with Arquette's own discovery that human life isn't so pure and her feral life previous, while persecuted, was truer than what she was now experiencing.
Crisp production design - reminiscent of Being John Malkovich, controls the surreal humor into a dream-like expression of the modern world. A fan of any of the other films mentioned in this piece will be a fan of this too.

0219822,0689316,modamag,"A very crude, slow and unstructured journey","""Human Nature"" is a comedy written by ""Being John Malkovich's"" Charlie Kaufman and it doesn't fail to carry the distinct aroma of his previous film. The film explores our so-called ""primal urges"" and our need to live naturally with deep consideration of those urges.
Patricia Arquette plays Lila Jute, a human naturist who has a little problem. She is suffering from a hormonal balance that causes her to be abnormally covered with body hair. While this does not pose much of a concern for her personally, it does for everyone else and more specifically, men. After getting fed up with the world, she decided to live in the forest amongst the animals and write best-selling nature books. However the animal in her begins to miss the precious company of men and so she returns to civilization. Lila shaves her body hair and begins a somewhat odd relationship with Nathan Bronfman (Tim Robbins). Nathan happens to be an etiquette scientist who tries to teach mice and Lila table manners. One day, Lila and Nathan come across an untamed man (Rhys Ifans) who was raise by a father who believed himself to be a monkey. That man is later nicknamed Puff. The Puff creature happens to be the perfect subject for Dr. Nathan Bronfman as he changes Puff's wild ways to more more cultivated conduct. Lila is left torn between lying about her ""human nature"" or embracing her urges and running wild.
Perhaps I'm as prude as Tim Robbins's character, however there is no appreciation of the refined gross-out humor in my sight. It appears as though the crude humor found its way into the movie for no reason other than the fact it could. Luckily the film makes up for that in very unique cinematography. The interesting camera angles and settings take away a bit from the numerous unnecessary masturbation jokes and bodily fluid gags. There were many other ways that such a creative team of filmmakers could have coped with them in a more substantial manner and prevented their detraction of the finer aspects of the movie.
The finer aspects of the film include the brilliant acting from some of the somewhat less familiar faces in Hollywood. Actress Patricia Arquette creates a character that is believable, originative and daring. She inhibits Lila with great ease and manages to push all the right buttons to make her tick just the right way. Rhys Ifans fills Puff's shoes with more content than expected. While he is able to add much to the film due to his comedic nature, there are a few points in the film where Rhys is able to show even greater depth. Both actors make great counterparts.
At times obscene and at others strange, the comedy manages to tackle some more thought-provoking issues, outside of humping. ""Human Nature"" discusses issues of evolution, the human desire to blend in and what it really is that makes us human. It walks through a somewhat slow and unstructured journey that imprints the difference between civilization, monkeys and mankind.
Despite its charms, ""Human Nature"" is not what it could have been. It does not live up to its potential because the filmmakers decided to make too many hollow & irrelevant stops and too few truly important ones. In the end, ""Nature"" is daring, well acted, unique, intelligent in spirit and very very crude.

0219822,2383060,Imdbidia,Entertaining and thought-provoking,"An enjoyable thought-provoking film with a bunch of great ideas, as once can expect from the combo Kauffmam & Gondry, but not as well grounded, mixed and presented as in other collaborations of the pair. This is a movie that explores human nature through the concept of noble savage and its reverse.

The main question posed is, What is natural to humans? What makes us humans, Culture or instinct? To exemplify what is natural or unnatural to humans, sex is used as a medium of exploration. Through the sexual behavior of the different characters -all of them very different in personality and upbringing- we see who they really are and what is common to all of them.

The ideas and concepts explored in the film are fascinating and presented in a light way. The contradictions of human behavior and spirit are very well depicted. We see how Culture and instinct intertwine in an unnatural way, how the instinct is tamed and masked to allow itself to express, and when it does express, it does so in an unnatural way.

For example, the role of savage Puff is taught to repress his sexual urges in public as a non-acceptable human behavior, but then we see that doing that with prostitutes, for money, in a sub-world, is accepted and not considered unnatural, when in fact it is. At the same time, Nathan, the scientist training Puff, is obsessed with the importance of manners as a characteristic element of human civilization, but then he craves wild sex and cheats on his girlfriend giving way to his most basic sexual urges while he, at the same time, is telling Puff to repress his.

Another good exploration, not that usual in movies where the noble savage is a theme, is the retraining ""backwards"" of the savage, from civilized to savage to be natural and human again. That's perhaps the most original exploration in the movie.

The acting is OK in general. I though that Patricia Arquette is good and believable in her role as Lila, a weirdo lonely writer who craves love and spiritual connection. However, I thought the best of the bunch was Miranda Otto, in her brilliant interpretation of Gabrielle, a raunchy naughty scientist fake-French assistant. She's so funny in her role! I liked the fake 60s images of the characters' childhood, the super-cute experiments and images with the mice learning to eat with forks, and the scenes of Natham in ""heaven"".

The end is unexpected and shocking, and shows again, how this story is not moralistic, and how it is in human nature not to be natural and natural at the same time.

So, you'd be asking by now, why all these good elements make me rate the movie with just a 6.5. That's because there is not one element that amalgamates all the good philosophical elements of the film to turn it into something memorable and easy to understand for everybody. The dialogs are poor. The comedy is not comic enough most of the time. The viewer can get lost in what he/she sees, and not in the good bits of the movie. There is not a moving strong love story either, sex being the main subject of the movie. Moreover, the movie has this kitsch atmosphere that is not everybody liking; yes, it is comic, but it is still kitsch and sometimes even cheesy.

0219822,1051399,TheNorthernMonkee,"not Kaufman's finest, but still enjoyable at times","SPOILERS To a lot of film fans, Charlie Kaufman is a bit of a cult legend. Creating often surreal works of genius, Kaufman is recognised for such greats as ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"". One of his works which often passes over the grid however is 2001's ""Human Nature"". Written after Malkovich but before ""Adaptation"" it is another obscure film from the writer, which is enjoyable but never quite shines to it's fullest potential.

Born with a rare genetic defect, Lila Jute (Patricia Arquette) begins to develop body hair when she is in her teens. Now in her early 30s, Lila has returned from a number of years in the wilderness looking for love. Dating Doctor Nathan Bronfman (Tim Robbins), a man with an equally complex past, things seem to be going well. That is, until the introduction of the mysterious ape man Puff (Rhys Ifans) and the seductive Gabrielle (Miranda Otto).

Often working with either Michael Gondry or Spike Jonze (Gondry being the director of ""Human Nature""), Charlie Kaufman has a remarkable record of writing high standard films. Often suffering from an inability to conclude stories (""Adaptation"" and ""Malkovich"" falling flat towards the end), Kaufman's true skill comes in writing stories that are not only obscure, but so extremely surreal that you feel intelligent for just making the effort to watch the film.

In ""Human Nature"" something feels like it has gone wrong however. Whilst so many of Kaufman's films are addictive and keep you focused until the often anti-climatic finale, ""Human Nature"" has a tendency to drag. Whether this is down to the script or some annoying performances by Tim Robbins and Rhys Ifans (Ifans' accent in particular grates), it's difficult to say, but the one definite fact is that this film is just not Kaufman's finest.

It would be unfair to simply slate ""Human Nature"" without addressing some of it's qualities. With great performances by Arquette and Otto, the film is not completely lacking in acting talent. These two women give life to their characters brilliantly, and whilst Robbins and Ifans might put in surprisingly weak performances, the film is saved to a degree by the two female leads.

As well as the female dominance, the film's script does in fact have some really brilliant moments. With a few memorable scenes, it does have the potential to make it's audience laugh. Sadly for Kaufman though, these glorious times are far too rare and the story slips gently into a non-entity.

It's hard to imagine anyone who could hate Charlie Kaufman. Writing some truly amazing films, Kaufman stands to accept awards with a look of awkwardness and embarrassment. If anything, the man remains as interesting a figure, as those that he creates. Still, with ""Human Nature"", he reminds us that he is far from the perfect author. Often creating magnetic films which have weak endings, it feels strange to watch a film which never really takes off. ""Human Nature"" DOES have it's moments of glory, but for a Kaufman film, they are far too rare and as a result, the film slips into obscurity. If you want to watch Kaufman, your better off sticking to some of his other works.",6.0,2005-04-01,0,2,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0
0219822,1636435,jazzpiano-,The Wayward-ness of Humankind,"'Human Nature' is a completely underrated feature, intelligently written by Charlie Kaufman and soundly directed by Michel Gondry in his feature film debut. 'Human Nature' suffered from high expectations - after 'Being John Malkovich' everybody expected another brain-bending masterpiece, and instead received a subtle, wry and quietly philosophical comedy, open to all kinds of interpretation and featuring beautiful, under-appreciated performances from Patricia Arquette, Tim Robbins and Rhys Ifans.
Lila Jute (Patricia Arquette) suffers from a hormonal problem that causes hair to grow all over her body, which first appeared in her pre-teens. Convinced by her mother that she would never get a man, Lila went to live in the woods among the animals, and become a nature writer. The books were successful, and in her new found fame, Lila could afford to become ""a hairless lie""; to get electrolysis. Through Louise, who performs the electrolysis, Lila meets Dr. Nathan Bronfman, a bespectacled manners-obsessed virgin and scientist, currently working on a ""large sociological project"" involving mice. Lila and Nathan are immediately attracted to each other, and are soon living together. One day, on a hike in the woods, the pair discover a human raised by a man who thought he was an ape, completely uncontaminated by civilisation. Nathan decides the man needs to experience civilisation (""Never to know the love of a good woman or appreciate the complex works of Moby Dick or marvel at Monet?""), and decides to 'save' him, by teaching him manners and decorum.
What results from the oddball plot is a hilarious and occasionally touching investigation into human nature, that doesn't just come right out and say, ""Humans are deceitful and always will be!"" or the like, but leaves it up to you to decide.
Patricia Arquette gives a sincere performance, and provides the most touching moments in the film. She shows incredible range in this film; from her naive desire to please Nathan by becoming a ""real girl"", wearing pink, painting her nails and taking up ballet, to becoming a warrior. Lila is vulnerable when she is with Nathan, but she transforms herself (with the help of Louise) and becomes strong and confident.
Tim Robbins is convincing as a bordering obsessive compulsive, and shows great comedic timing in the first few scenes with Patricia Arquette. It was an interesting choice to have Tim Robbins talk about his actions in retrospect, and then see him act them out with pure selfishness and inability to control his lusting.
Rhys Ifan's performance as Puff is the same standard as Arquette's. He demonstrates a large range; from an 'ape' to the apex of 'refinement'. There is one scene in particular, where footage of Puff as an 'ape' is shown, while the reformed Puff stands calmly as it plays, knowingly, in a very civilised suit.
'Human Nature' is a bit of a mixed bag film - it even morphs into a musical for a moment near the beginning, in a song sung by Patricia Arquette herself (what a beautiful, restrained voice!). Sometimes it's surreal, as with the scene I mentioned in the last paragraph. The humour in the film is mostly created by scenes where the flaws of humankind are exposed - our indifference, how we pretend to be something we're not, how we like to separate ourselves from nature even though that's where we came from, before civilisation.
I love the open-endedness of this film! It is the best thing about it. Also, I enjoyed Gondry's sneaky references to Bjork's 'Human Behaviour' video clip.",9.0,2007-04-13,3,1,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0
0219822,1647691,directjw,A Freudian Comedy,"Freud stated that all human behavior is determined by primal instincts, such as sex and hunger.
Kaufman and Gondry's Human Nature brilliantly explores this notion, and it is a blast to watch.
This is one of the funniest, most intelligent films I have ever seen about human relationships...if Woody Allen and Salvador Dali ever collaborated on a film, it would look something like Human Nature.
What makes this film so brilliant is that it explores so many intelligent themes, such as American versus French culture, the battle of the sexes, the survival instinct, the dangers of repression and the resultant outbreak of the Id, and yet is able to sustain a lighthearted, surreal sense of humor throughout it all.
I believe that the reason this film was not so well-received was because Being John Malkovich was so well-received, that expectations were exceedingly high for Kaufman's follow up film, Human Nature. When Human Nature turned out to be a vastly different film from Being John Malkovich, the critics predictably were not satisfied with the film.
Michel Gondry, the director of Human Nature, is a true original, and all of his subsequent films, Eternal Sunshine, Dave Chappelle's Block Party, and the Science of Sleep, are also brilliant.
But for me, Human Nature is his best film so far, because it is able to balance the drama and the comedy without one overwhelming the other, as in Eternal Sunshine.",10.0,2007-05-02,3,1,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0

0219822,4770978,bowmanblue,"Daft, but strangely endearing","What is 'Human Nature' about? That's pretty hard to sum up, let alone do one's best to do so without giving away major spoilers. Er, I guess it's about 'nature versus nurture.' Then again, maybe not. There's a love story in there. Or is it two? It's narrated partly by someone who's dead and there's a woman with excessive body hair. Does that give the impression of its weirdness suitably? I hope so. It is pretty weird. But then what do you expect from Charlie Kaufman.
Charlie Kaufman is best known for 'Being John Malkovich' (and possible 'Adaptation' and 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'). And, in case you haven't seen any of those, they're pretty 'far out there,' too. You have to be in the mood for one of his films, but, if you are, you'll really enjoy yourself.
Not only is the casting perfect, but whatever weirdness is on screen somehow seems to completely work within the world that it's set. Patricia Arquette plays 'Lila,' a woman who doesn't just have a bit of a prominent 'mono-brow' that requires plucking every day. She literally has thick 'ape-like' hair all over her body since puberty, leaving little careers available to her besides 'bearded lady' at a travelling circus. However, seeing as the health plan there wasn't to her liking, she decides not to simply be a freak that people stare at and, instead, goes and lives in the wood.
There she happily co-exists with nature until her female 'body clock' starts going into overdrive and she desperately requires the 'services' of a man in order to procreate. Therefore, the hair must go and she find love in the arms of Tim Robbin's scientist, 'Nathan.' But will this love run smooth? And what will happen when he realises all her little 'bodily secrets.' And what about another naked man played by Rhys Ifans who's lived in the woods all his life? Those are the three main characters and, although all may not necessarily be relatable, they're all good fun to watch. And special mention to Miranda Otto as the sexy, seductive (apparently) French lab assistant.
'Human Nature' certainly won't appeal to everyone. It's too 'out there' to be mainstream and there's no real 'laugh out loud' gags to call it an outright comedy, but it's quirky enough not to just be thought of as a 'drama.' It's a combination of a lot of things, but if you're looking for a cheeky little film that you'll actually have to watch, rather than check your phone every five minutes then this one will certainly leave a lasting impression on you (and not just for the excessive hairy nudity!).",9.0,2019-04-09,1,0,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0
0219822,0689333,AlgisKuliukas,Delightfully refreshing comedy,"I didn't take this film very seriously and thought it was a delight. Some of the scenes and lines were just hillarious (like the one which ended with Puff's ""Woopee!"" at the promise of more desert after having his natural sexual urges zapped out of him for the past half hour. If you let go of any notion of plausibility and just go with its crazy story line I think anyone with a wacky sense of humour will like it too.
I have to add just one point of fact to correct a line which just irritated me when Nathan's father told his son that pygmy chimps are the closest relatives to humans and sort of implied that it was because we only had one chromosome less than they do. Actually all four types of great apes: common chimps (Pan troglodytes), bonobos or pygmy chimps - the species Puff thought he was growing up as - (Pan paniscus), gorilla (Gorilla sp.) and orang-utan have the same (48) number of chromosomes whereas humans have 46. The reason Pan (both chimps and bonobos actually) are said to be closer to humans than the other apes is because they have fewer genic (that is informational, or base-pair) differences in the genes inside those chromsomes... ...but, hey, it's no biggie.

0219822,2022958,swillsqueal,Ape Fest,"The evolution of a species has much to do with its ability to live in harmony with the Earth. Those plants and animals which don't or can't live in harmony with their environment don't survive.
Humans make history. That's one of their adaptive characteristics. Reason evolves out of environments totally dominated by Nature into ones which are symbiotically entwined with Nature. Instinct needs to be tamed a bit by reason in order for humanity to gradually civilize itself--a psychologically repressive venture to be sure, one that spawns many neuroses. But then, as Freud told us in CIVILIZATION AND ITS DISCONTENTS, repression of instinct, freedom and the id is necessary to keep civilization together.
But is the civilization we've got, the best of all possible worlds? Imagine sitting in an office all day, pushing paper at some ultimately, meaningless desk job when you'd really rather be having sex with the secretarial staff. Repress those thoughts and carry-on... or not, as Puff's father did one day when he decided that he'd had enough of this civilization stuff. That was the day, Puff's father decided to jump up onto his desk, screech his way out of work and become an ape--literally to go back to Nature. ""Prison break!""
""Human Nature"" is funny. On the one hand you have a mild mannered scientist named Dr. Nathan Bronfman who is trying to introduce civilized table manners to white mice within a lab setting and on the other you have a father who has kidnapped his young son from the civilized lap of his mother in order to raise him ""Wild Child"" style, as an ape in the forests of an overly industrialized America. ""Human Nature"" is funny because of juxtapositions like these. You see, within this industrialized America there is no room for a dwarf with an IQ of 170, who has a Phd to get any work outside of selling his labour time as a side-show freak, 'flying' an airplane costume in a circus ring, complete with a hairy woman who plays King Kong on the Empire State building (that famous last scene where, it wasn't the airplane who killed Kong, 'it was beauty killed the beast'). Hairy, sexy Lila can't earn a living in any other way than by playing King Kong to a side-show dwarf in airplane costume. Looks can be deceiving and the language of deceit is a large part of what civilized behaviour demands.
People can't accept Lila as she is and she knows it. Much as the mythical Tarzan and King Kong, Lila's being violates the decorum of civilization itself. So, she decides to drop out of her side-show wage-slavery, much like Puff's dad and so the ape fest goes until ape meets ape-ess; ape meets civilization; ape-ess meets man and jungle; man meets Lila in hairless disguise and dwarf meets Lila's friend, the beautician with the wickedly snappy electrolysis wand.
""Human Nature"" is not only great comedy, it's a semi-profound speculative discourse on just what human nature is and how some of that nature is changed and some not changed through the history which humans make, write and remember. Thus, ""Human Nature"" has more to say to us than films with a similar plot outline e.g., ""The Mystery of Kasper Hauser"". It's also much funnier than your standard sexual farce.
Give ""Human Nature"" a chance. See it and maybe, uncover some of your own basic instincts. Experience the refreshing wisdom of laughing at yourselves. And, hint, it wouldn't hurt to find a copy of the Kinks'sardonic ""Apeman"" to listen to before you start the movie.",8.0,2009-02-14,2,2,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0

The film's script is what is the real Big Deal, masterly written it could have beenn more clearly interpreted however, because as a result, many people seem to have missed an important theme* which simply adds to the enjoyment.

Rhys Ifans as Puff further adds to his reputation as a movie gem, especially in his scenes with congress.

Don't expect anything halfway normal in the ironically-titled ""Human Nature,"" the first collaboration between the brilliant Michel Gondry and even more brilliant Charlie Kaufman. Forget style above substance, this is a thinking man's comedy, quirky and utterly hilarious. This film begins with the revelation that Nathan Bronfman (Tim Robbins) is dead, courtesy of a small round bullet hole in his forehead, and somewhere in the afterlife in a room where everything is white. In prison is Lila Jute (Patricia Arquette), and testifying before some Congressional committee is a nattily dressed but strangely bearded man named Puff (Rhys Ifans). Apparently there are issues about being ""sorry"" that this film will explain, but first we have to get up to speed on how this strange collection of characters came to be strange.
""Human Nature"" is full of brilliant ideas, but the whole touch of the film is less outlandish than the other. Actually, you may say some scenes are direct parody of methods used in classic Hollywood films, and some scenes, especially opening ten minutes, even remind you of films such as ""American Beauty"" and ""A Life Less Ordinary."" By saying that, I do not mean the lack of originality; rather, the director Gondry is cleverly challenging us with unique skills shown in these film, deftly using them to his purpose. And the most amusing thing about ""Human Nature"" is its ever-changing relationships of love between four characters, among which Puff's sadly too human nature plays the most prominent role. Puff also gets most of the good lines, from pointing out at the start that being raised by a man who thinks he is an ape is pretty much the same as actually being raised by apes to his recognition of a stage that exists before a beloved teacher takes a student from crayons to perfume. While not as easy a crowd-pleaser as Kaufman's previous work, ""Human Nature"" has its fair share of oddball moments. Enough so that anyone looking for another iconoclastic romp will do well enough if they look here.

0219822,2284412,bbhlthph,How do we differ from other animals?,"Most films, other than remakes, originate when a film studio commissions a writer to prepare an outline script and suggest a treatment for adapting some best selling book to movie form. Indie Directors may work quite closely with a script-writer of their choice right from the start and this gives the procedure a better chance of ultimate success; but too often the storyline for a book that one may read over a period of days or weeks is almost incompatible with the requirements of a two hour movie. Charlie Kaufman was a script writer who learned this the hard way, and who has since become respected by cinema-goers throughout the world for the very challenging original scripts that he has created. ""Human Nature"" was the second of these; but to better appreciate its unusual structure and meaning, it is helpful to first take a birds eye look at what his works are typically about. He learned his trade working for television, often episodes of established serials, and then amazed the cinema world by writing a new and very different script which became the enormously successful film ""Being John Malkovich"". This was so bizarre that it is almost impossible to describe before it has been viewed, but essentially it features the concept of a number of different individuals sharing the same personality simultaneously. I am amazed (although very grateful) that it was able to attract investors and actually reach the screen. Its success showed there is an unsatisfied demand for films which make us think deeply about our own nature, and it helped Kaufman to write and co-produce ""Human Nature"" (2001). This perhaps remains his most ambitious film, and is the first I am commenting on for IMDb, but a overview of all his works remains helpful when considering any Kaufman film. 1992 brought a semi-autobiographical film in which he clearly outlined his approach to preparing a film-script. Columbia had film rights to Susan Orlean's book ""The Orchid Thief"" and had commissioned him to prepare a film-script. After months of work he was convinced this lengthy and rambling book could not be effectively condensed into the span of a movie. With considerable trepidation he submitted a fictional script based on his struggle to create a work of art, but contrasting this with that of an imaginary twin brother who became rich by shamelessly churning out scripts for stereotyped action thrillers. To his relief this script was accepted and became the film ""Adaption"" in which Kaufman explores the conflict so many experience between artistic, commercial or scientific integrity and financial gain. By this stage he had gained a cult reputation for scripts which examined what it was in human nature that could sometimes raise humanity above, and sometimes force it below, the level of other animals. His later films, including ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" (which examines the implications of an ability to selectively erase specific memories) or ""Synecdoche, New York"" (with many targets including formal religion and the need to exploit every chance for personal fulfilment during life) have only added to this. Cinema-goers may love his films or hate them, but few will remain indifferent.

To those who have not seen any of his films the only sensible recommendation is -Try one. This lengthy introduction should give some idea what to expect. The most conventional is probably ""Adaption"" but I would suggest ""Human Nature"" because, whilst not the most profound, it is among the most comprehensive in its chosen targets and yet it does not seem overloaded or obtuse, also it includes a great deal of deliberate comedy which maintains both interest and enjoyment. The story involves a young woman, unhappy with her hirsute appearance, who abandons society and reverts to nature; but also writes a very successful book about her experiences which finances her to return to have her problem corrected.. She then becomes mutually attracted to a nerdish repressed scientist struggling to teach mice good manners. On a field trip they encounter a youth brought up in the forest as an ape by a father who threw up a good job in order to revert to nature. They take him back to the laboratory too see how easy it will be to teach him normal human manners. Much of the film is devoted to the strong pulls he experiences both towards his new cultured life and back to his previous uncontrolled environment. These of course become particularly severe when he becomes involved with young women. Such sequences bring out a favourite Kaufman theme - the necessity for personal fulfilment if one is to avoid mental breakdown.

This summary does little to explain the charm of the film, but to say much more would spoil it. It discusses a wider range of issues than most of his works, has an easy to follow story and is full of very amusing sequences; so I would have expected it to be the most popular. Instead it's IMDb rating (currently 6.9) is lowest. I cannot help wondering why; but Patricia Arquette as Lila (the hirsute young lady hero) displayed her unusual although not unattractive fur covering during several of the earlier sequences in the forest, explaining why it is R rated only in US theatres, so we can suspect the widespread North American distrust of any displays of nudity in films. Maybe there are other reasons that I did not notice, but I would be interested to know if it was also less successful in Europe where nudity is less of a concern.

0219822,0689313,Buddy-51,mostly humorless attempt at wild satire,"`Human Nature' shows what can happen when a couple of filmmakers allow critical acclaim for a previous work to go to their heads.  Writer Charlie Kaufman and co-producer Spike Jonze were the creative forces behind the almost universally praised `Being John Malkovich' from a few years back (Jonze was the director of that film actually, while Michael Gondry gets that credit on this film).  `Offbeat' and `bizarre' were probably the mildest terms one could apply to that movie, but no matter how utterly insane the proceedings became, one could never fault `Being John Malcovich' for being a messy, undisciplined work.  `Human Nature' is another case altogether.  Kaufman seems to have fallen into the trap of believing that, as long as you have at least some unifying theme upon which to hang your unconventional components, you are free to put pretty much anything you want up on the screen and get away with it.  Guess again.
The theme Kaufman has chosen to explore is that old chestnut about how humans, in their attempt to deny their ancestral association with the animal kingdom, are always working to suppress their natural instincts under the weight of `civilization' and `culture.'  All the characters in this film are, in one way or another, trying to repress either their own basic animal nature or trying to repress someone else's.  Thus we have beautiful Patricia Arquette portraying a young woman who, through a hormonal fluke that seems to harken back to humanity's evolutionary connection with our fellow primates, has had to endure (from puberty on up) a body almost completely covered by hair.  Therefore, she spends most of her adult life undergoing painful electrolysis treatments under the patient and sympathetic ministrations of Rosie Perez.  The irony is that Arquette, even after she has come to accept her natural state, realizes that she can only get her sexual needs met if she conforms to society's standards of physical beauty. Tim Robbins plays a bizarre cross between Charles Darwin and Professor Henry Higgins as a researcher who lives to make animals more human-like in their behavior and finds his most intriguing challenge in a man the two of them discover living on his own in the wild - having been raised by his deranged father to believe he actually IS an ape (Rhys Ifans plays the human guinea pig).  He, too, finds that he can only achieve sexual gratification if he, paradoxically, plays by civilized society's rules.
It's hard to know whether or not this particular material could ever have been successfully realized on screen, no matter who thought it up Perhaps the imagery  of a hirsute Arquette, of a naked Ifans  is simply too unappealing and unpleasant to raise any emotion other than disgust in the viewer.  Perhaps it is the obvious, heavy-handed nature of the theme or the chintzy way in which it is visualized that keeps the concept earthbound. Whatever the cause, `Human Nature' thuds along from one unfunny scene and moment to the next, doing little but embarrassing these otherwise fine actors and actresses in the process.
Recently, in an earlier review, I lamented the fact that there seemed to be no end to bad cinematic reworkings of the `Pygmalion' story  and, alas, `Human Nature' can now be added to that growing list of hopeless failures. The only consolation, in fact, may be that George Bernard Shaw is not around to have to bear witness to them all.  Perhaps now we can finally move on to fresher territory.",,2002-04-14,1,4,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0

0219822,3039865,wandereramor,"A minor work, but still worthwhile","Human Nature is easily the least-remembered and least-talked about film in Charlie Kaufman's small but memorable body of work, and probably in Michel Godnry's ouevre as well. That's not too surprising -- it was a box office flop, is rather rough around the edges, and was part of the tail end of a bunch of 90s indy romcoms that everyone would like to forget. But I think Human Nature is definitely worth revisiting, especially given the slim odds of a new Kaufman film any time soon.
Like Kaufman's other films, Human Nature grapples with the artificiality and all-encompassing anxiety of everyday life. Lila and Nathan are consumed with the attempt to deny their animal nature, which in effect means denying their own bodies. But despite their hours of etiquette training and electrolysis, animality keeps bursting out. The return to the wild and the acknowledgement of the animal appears for a time as a way to escape the postmodern anxiety that Kaufman constantly grapples with. But in the end, this is too easy a solution, and primitivism becomes another mediated narrative and ultimately a postmodern joke. But the escape to the wild was fun while it lasted -- and maybe, just maybe, there's something genuinely positive there.
Beyond the philosophical point, it's also funny movie that doesn't overstay its welcome. While thoroughly enjoyable, Human Nature doesn't take it easy on the audience, despite being in a genre associated with crowd-pleasing. All of the three central characters alternate between being sympathetic and repulsive, and if there's a romance we're supposed to be rooting for, it becomes very unclear by the end.
Kaufman's script is as good as ever, but many of the surrounding elements are pedestrian. Michel Gondry shows no sign of his usual visual flair or directorial ambition. Rhys Ilfan is good in a role that mixes endearing dorkishness with serial-killer menace, but other than him and a brief appearance by Peter Dinklage the performances are unremarkable and quickly forgotten. None of the visual or performative elements are exactly bad, but they lack the kind of inventiveness that would have made this film truly shine. Human Nature would have benefited from a Wes Anderson or a Rian Johnson at the helm.
Human Nature probably deserves its status as Kaufman/Gondry minora, but it's still well worth watching. Like most good art, it raises more questions than it answers, leaving the audience to find a way to reconcile the demands of nature and culture. If this is the worst movie you make, you're doing something right.",8.0,2014-06-22,0,1,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0
0219822,0689342,sansmerci,"Good, Not Great","Those of you reading the comments for this film might be confused at the fact that the comments seem to be so bipolar.  Everyone seems to either love or hate this film and few people seem to be inbetween.  I can see why, since the material in and of itself is the sort of thing that would draw a lot of conflicting opinions, and the style of the film is odd, which will enrage some and attract others.  Personally, I found this controversy of opinions to be compelling, and I rented the film.  Partially because of the comments on this board, but mostly because I simply adored Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which is the latest and only other film to be written by the incredible Charlie Kaufman and Michel Gondry.
Here's my opinion, perhaps the only non-polarized one on the board:  I felt that it was good, but not great.  Charlie Kaufman has certainly written far better scripts in his career, and Michel Gondry did a far better job on Eternal Sunshine as well as his music video work.  The tone of the film was goofy, which made sense artistically, but wasn't really goofy enough to grab my attention.  On top of that, the film does break tone from time to time, getting a little too over the top (although, it is over the top from the beginning, which works, but it seems to exceed its own limits at times).  Overall, it's some pretty solid writing and directing, but what's missing is anything to make this film really stick out as special.
However, what I find particularly impressive about this film is that, when watching this AND Eternal Sunshine, you can really see the incredible range that Michel Gondry has (as does Kaufman, but I was already aware of that from his other works).  Eternal Sunshine and Human Nature are two of very few feature films that Gondry has directed, and they are incredibly different films.  Eternal Sunshine maintains a very realistic tone throughout the film, while Human Nature's tone is more cartoonish (which is ironic since Eternal Sunshine contains more fantastic elements).  Eternal Sunshine has a somewhat gritty feel to it (or as much of one as a comedy can have) and, visually, focuses on a specific color scheme and low-key lighting.  Human Nature is far more evenly lit and doesn't seem to have much of a specific color scheme.  Yet, in both films, he manages to execute his decisions well (though far better in Eternal Sunshine).
Human Nature is not the greatest film in the world, but it is worth it to see the work of a great and talented director.",,2004-05-15,0,1,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0
0219822,0689307,Davros-4,Hollywood's inhumanity to audiences,"When I was passed a test screening ticket for ""Human Nature"" by a furtive young man in a painfully unfashionable anorak in a slightly disreputable part of London, I could be forgiven for thinking I was being invited to the screening of a film of immoral virtue. When I finally stumbled into the night after watching it, I wished it had been pornography I had been watching, not the absolute insult to celluloid manufacturers everywhere that is ""Human Nature"". To say I was disappointed is the biggest understatement since the pilot of the Hindenberg told reporters he'd never quite got the hang of landing. The film stars Tim Robbins, Patricia Arquette, Rhys Ifans, and Miranda Otto and I think I could have been forgiven for thinking that this cast alone gave the film more potential than ""Cannonball Run II"" and I was actually looking forward to seeing it. Tim Robbins can act the pants of most other actors around; Patricia Arquette is an adequate actress and can be convincing when she needs to be; Miranda Otto is riding the new wave of Antipodean talent in Hollywood; and although Rhys Ifans will be in any film, anywhere, any time for the price of a biscuit and a cup of tea, he is a talented comic performer. So what went wrong? Well, the easier question to answer would be what went right? The answer is nothing went right - the film is a complete mess of unexplored themes and unfinished thoughts giving it what feels to the viewer like an identity crisis. Just what is this film trying to be? It tells the story of several people with challenges (not least the director Michel Gondry who had the unenviable task of filming this dross, but I digress). Robbins plays a behavioural scientist (with a small penis and a confidence problem) named Nathan Bronfman, Arquette plays a writer with a hormone problem which makes her grow hair allover her body named Lila, and Ifans is a man brought up in the woods as an ape. Bronfman and Lila discover the apeboy while hiking, and decide to use him to further their experiments in behavioural science. They will turn this wild, untamed man into a pillar of modern society - a startlingly original concept (see ""California Man"", ""Tarzan in New York"", George of the Jungle"",  and countless other movies). The story jumps around flashing forward and backward, even utilising a dead person as a narrator (has that EVER worked in a film?) as it tries to flesh out the story of human nature and how it is repressed or exploited by the modern world. At least that is what I think it is about - the film never decides what it wants to say, do or be. It tries for undergraduate ""gross out"" humour, as well as attempting deep moments of pathos, and also even chances some drama. Usually when a film tries to be several things at once, you get the impression if it had chosen one identity, it would have been better for it - the thing is, with this film, I don't think it would have succeeded on any of the levels it attempts to visit. ""Human Nature"" looks like it got halfway through production as a serious movie before someone seeing the rushes announced it wasn't working and that they were going to have to play it for laughs. The result is a film which has a scene of intended dramatic pathos where Arquette, in a hysterical fit of self loathing shaves herself of all of her hair, cutting herself bloody in the process, right next to a scene of Ifans humping the leg of a waitress in a trendy New York restaurant.
Not dramatic, and not funny. The film stumbles along for 90 minutes and then falls over itself in rushing to an ending, mirroring the chaos in the aisles as the audience rushed for the exit. It is astounding to note that the writer (Charlie Kaufman) and producer (Spike Jonze) of this drivel are the men who gave the world ""Being John Malkovich"". If the creators of something so original, so inventive, and so good can turn around and deliver this piece of shambolic nonsense next time around, what hope is there for human nature?

0219822,0689306,NeelyO,Charlie Kaufman can't write third acts,"Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman received a great deal of acclaim for his ""Being John Malkovich"" script, but while that film contained many quirky and inventive ideas, the plot fell apart in the third act, making for an ultimately unsatisfying experience. The same can be said for his second produced script, ""Human Nature,"" which is chock-full of good ideas but ultimately unravels. Kaufman is clever and a jokester, he's just not much of a scenarist.
On the up side, there's a lovely performance by Patricia Arquette, who's not afraid of any of the many bizarre turns her character goes through, and director Michel Gondry (who has made terrific videos for Bjork and others) does the best that he can with the script.

Actually, ""Human Nature"" is not the answer to that question, but it does address other issues, one of which is the nature of comedy. Many, if not most, people who see ""Human Nature"" will not care for it.  I was going to say ""not get it"", but that is condescending.  I think ""Human Nature"" is a hilarious comedy.  It's extreme adsurdity makes it so.  It combines elements of Pygmalion, Frankenstein and Tarzan into a wonderful, modern day farce. The story is about a love rectangle formed by Nathan Bronfman (Robbins), Lila Jute (Arquettte), Puff (Ifans), and Gabrielle (Otto).  Nathan and Gabrielle are somewhat normal (as normal as two scientists can be), but  Lila and Puff are a bit off center.  She has a problem with body hair which covers her whole body, and Puff, was raised in the wild by his father, who thought he was a gorilla. The story is told through flashback by the dead Nathan, the testifying Puff, and the arrested Lila.  Wonderfully done. The one question I had throughout was how Puff came to be testifying in front of congress.  The answer was so pat and contrived it was funny. My advice is, go see this movie with 4 or 5 friends, and try and predict which one of you will like it.  The rest will hate it.",,2002-04-05,30,6,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0

Being John Malkovich .. is pretty shallow, not strong work. I still adore it, but it's worst Kaufmans work for me, though it's extremely original.
Adaptation brings out greatest thoughts about movie-making, about human relations, about creativity and Hollywood, about mainstream and real art. And the funny thing Adaptation even mocks about itself. Great script.
Eternal Sunshine is mainly about love, destiny and memories. Nothing else there. Though i have to admit it's a perfect script.
Human Nature is an anti-human, Greenpeace-pro movie... till the very end. It mocks humanity sometimes, but mostly talks about how self-important we are, how ungracious to the nature around us. But the end ... Well, wont write spoilers here.

0219822,2259210,frankvandal,Decent film does not live up to it's potential,"With the talent of Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman, the idea had enormous potential to be a profound and insightful exploration. But the entire project just fell flat. It was clever in parts, and overall it was different and interesting, but it was by no means a brilliant work of art or a truly meaningful look into human and animal existence. Many of the elements were present, but they never actually came together in any meaningful form. The opening scene wonderfully illustrates what should have been developed throughout the remainder of the film. After the titles roll by, we see a pair of mice (having successfully escaped a predator) walk by a dead human body with no interest or concern. With an odd sort of humor, we can see the difference between human culture and that of the natural world. Clearly, the mice do not care about filing police reports, notifying the press, learning about the deceases family, and all of the other hundreds of mundane things we humans do without thinking twice. Sadly, this sort of clever writing does not carry throughout the rest of the film. In addition, the acting is mediocre, and the characters feel as if they were not fully developed. The odd quarks and bizarre ideas, so much a trademark of Kaufman, are few and far between and seem as though they were merely added as an afterthought in order to make it seem more unique. The basic idea is good, and Kaufman's writing does manage to hold interest, but it is nothing special. The sad part is it had the potential to be a nearly perfect film. Somehow the great talent behind this move did not do nearly as much as they could have. Nonetheless, it is still a very worthwhile film. Kaufman's subtle presentation of ideas about life still manages to provoke thought, and it is a nice break (albeit a small one) from the traditional formula for movies.",7.0,2010-06-03,1,1,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0

0219822,0689297,nunculus,Multiple misunderstoods,"The screenwriter Charlie Kaufman--the only non-director screenwriter to be crowned an auteur in...ever, maybe?--has been rather unfortunately compared to the likes of Monty Python and Tom Stoppard. Higher-falutin folk, the kinsmen of Pauline Kael, have likened him this time out to John Guare, Christopher Durang and David O. Russell--an unsavory and unholy trinity if ever there was one. But Kaufman is much more interesting than that. This nature-versus-nurture farce may have plot construction that reminds middlebrows of their favorite Broadway smarty-pantses, but in essence the picture is closer to Marco Ferreri's flatulating comedies and Dusan Makavejev's back-to-the-body splatter heroics. Patricia Arquette is cursed by her body: she's hairy as an ape. Piqued at God, she decides to go ""back to nature,"" and live as the apes live. Her human-civilized training won't let her go all the way, and so she becomes a nature writer--a seemingly Rosseauian profession that is also a total unconscious betrayal of her natural ""freeness."" Horny and unloved, she is set up with Tim Robbins as a control-crazed, scientific Miss Manners who teaches laboratory mice to eat with the right fork. The two of them discover an apish man grunting in the wilds of Echo Park--and soon enough the chase is on, with romantic entanglements and switchoffs that make the parallelogram of partners in BEING JOHN MALKOVICH look antique, Scribean. HUMAN NATURE is not, as some other dopy Kaelian critics have carped, a sixties-style back-to-nature movie. (How did they miss the climactic scene in which Arquette tries to use electric-shock techniques, just like Robbins', to de-civilize the Ape Man and bring him back to Nature?) It does, however, use the metaphor of nature/nurture as a template for all the ways lovers make each other conform; and the way society makes us all chin up and salute. As in his forthcoming ADAPTATION, Kaufman's opinion of the ultimate value of all human endeavor is cheeringly bleak. In HUMAN NATURE, ""civilization"" is represented by an ape man in a plexiglass cage reading MOBY DICK to the crackle of a fake fireplace; and nature is a fallen place, unreturnable-to, the 21st-century cyber-citizen's joke. All that is ""human nature,"" Kaufman tells us, is the desire to burrow your genitals into someone else's. And Kaufman comes up with a picture of Civilization that's as pungent as any of Stanley Kubrick's similar critiques: the Ape-Man grinding his hips against a sixth-grade slide projector's images of naughty seventies porn--and then receiving a punitive electric shock that sends him hurtling across the room. The director, Michel Gondry, does not do a good job with the material. He was clearly stuck in an impossible bind. If he followed the appropriate path cleared by Spike Jonze in MALKOVICH--rendering Kaufman's whimseys in a dank, cruddy naturalistic, offhand style--he would seem no more than an imitator; instead he did what one feared Jonze would do--he has music-video'd up the script. And so Arquette, singing an Alan Menken-like paean to the unconditional love found in nature, does it against obviously tinny back projection that might work fine in a Bjork video, but here seems cloying, little-kiddish, sub-Wes-Anderson-y. Ditto the performance by that inevitable condescender and cartooner, Tim Robbins: he never plays a role, he lobs spitballs at it. Kaufman's gags, line by line, are not as sharp as they were in MALKOVICH; but the combination of highbrow literary techniques, and extreme abjection and cruelty, is almost identical. Kaufman makes 95% of the Writer's Guild of America look like slothful, bottom-feeding shmoes. Wait till you see ADAPTATION--a clever fellow's flabbergasting home run. In the mean time, please tell a friend that this guy is nothing like Tom Stoppard, or whatever innocently ""clever"" poetaster he is routinely compared to.

0219822,6278272,ftalker,SIMULTANAGNOSIA,"Very funny movie about a White culture so neurotically obsessed with social conformity that social behaviour becomes largely a pretence in which observing others becomes a form of social control wherein everyone is watching everyone else for signs of non-conformity.
In this scenario, personal relationships are inevitably faked, with a concomitant preoccupation with physical appearance and smart dress - along with emotionally-repressed behaviour. The characters know whom they are and what their actual natures are, which tell them what to do, yet most are openly resentful and overtly jealous of anyone courageous enough to actually love themselves for themselves - no matter the potential for social censure.
The funniest parts of the movie concern affectionless upbringings which leave many of the characters with a great difficulty in creating meaning in their lives and, thus, any kind of personal fulfilment. They become physical adults yet remain emotionally-immature in repeating the same psychologically-conditioned and emotionally-conditioning mistakes of their parents. Only the ethnic-minority characters have any genuine and expressive sense of life for us to contrast with the idiosyncacies of the White ones.
Underneath all of this simmering self-alienation is a desire for the kind of impassioned sex which helps us to understand ourselves with greater clarity and others with greater insight. Rhys IFANS' hilarious attempts at sexual congress with objects and strangers (which lead to mild electric shocks administered by the disapproving and his subsequent immersion in the world of prostitution) makes this point brilliantly. But the focus of so many of the characters on science, as opposed to intuition, as a means of self-realisation means few succeed at developing a full sense of their own humanity.
Despite it being as sexually coy, this movie is an eloquent plea for the essential humanity of humanity, which still does not endeavour to explain why White culture is so enamoured of the emotional repression shown here.",8.0,2020-11-16,2,0,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0

The movie may not be up to par with Kaufman's other works such as ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind,"" but it does great at utilizing the usual elements that make a great Kaufman script: Eccentricity, great dialogue, and sometimes dark humor.
This film also happens to be director Michel Gondry's first directorial effort. While the film does lack some of the trademarks that Gondry would use in the other films of his career, (specifically his manipulation of the mise en scene) this film is, after all, his first directorial effort. Sometimes directors don't immediately find out what their main style is on their debut films.
Then you have the performances of the cast. Tim Robbins and Patricia Arquette shine in their respectful places as the male and female leads, but I believe Rhys Ifans deserves a bit more love. His performance as Puff is one that I feel is wildly underrated.

0219822,1891012,loganx-2,Grossly Underrated,"Franz Kafka's ""A Report To An Academy"" is the story of an ape testifying before an academy the story of how he learned to speak and think like a human and why. Though he comes to love music and eventually accepts his fate, he admits that he only began learning from his human teachers as a way to escape from his cage. Michel Gondry's ""Human Nature"", is one of the earliest Charlie Kaufman(Bieng John Malkovich, Adaptation) scripts , and it takes Kafka's story and modernizes it in unexpected ways. A woman with a rare condition which causes her to grow hair all over her body in vast amounts, forsakes the world and becomes a nature writer, who leaves her isolation only to find a mate. Tom Robbins plays this mate, a fastidious, obsessive compulsive, scientist obsessed with teaching table manners to mice. The two then meet a man who was raised as an ape by his father who went insane after the Kennedy assassination, and the scientist and his now shaved assistant decide to make an example of the ape-man by civilizing him. If this sounds a bit ridiculous I should also add that there are three different versions of the story being narrated by Tim Robbins from the afterlife to whatever powers that be, Patricia Arquette to the police in an interrogation room, and Rhys Ifans (our ape man) testifying before congress.

Charlie Kaufman is, bar none, the most brilliant screenwriter in the world. In the world. His other films being contemporary classics, this as well as Confessions of a Dangerous Mind are not considered amongst Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Confessions is in my top 10 favorite movies, and Human Nature does not leave anything to be desired. In any Kaufman script, you will find a tremendously acute portrayal of life through the perspective of a great thinker. Kaufman has more depth, more fixed mental clarity, than most other writers in general. Human Nature, while being the only one of his movies that is a straight comedy, is no different in that respect.
It is fantastically entertaining as a comedy, keen as a social observation, and its cast provides performances that are among the most intriguing, sensitive, hilarious and arresting of their careers, subtle or not. Michel Gondry, the director, is pre-Eternal Sunshine, and is perhaps still honing his craft in terms of making a feature-length film. Eternal Sunshine is his masterpiece, but directorially, Human Nature is part of the latter stages of his warm-up period.
Human Nature is another one of those buried treasures that flies below the radar, and when people hear of it or see an ad for it, they mistake it for one of the movies that deservedly flies below the radar, waving it off saying, ""Well, if it's not that big a hit, then it must not be that good."" Don't make the mistake of passing this one up. It is one of the most inventive and intelligently funny comedies you'll ever see.",8.0,2006-09-24,1,1,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0
0219822,1989202,pmdawn,Humans are weird,"As a fan of Charlie Kaufman's works (and Gondry's as well) I was missing out on this movie big time. That's because I was initially put off by the description and most reviews which consider this a lesser movie. Well, they were wrong - this is an excellent movie on its own right.
""Human Nature"" is an extremely ironic and realistic movie in an exaggerated sort of way. Granted, it's not for everyone - there's a lot of semi-nudity (very light stuff), sexual tension and a story that requires you to think a little bit.
Actually, that's a lie - this movie has layers upon layers of symbolism, and that's just half the fun. The main characters are well thought-out and have their 'peculiarities' (like all humans do) taken to the extreme, which serve to illustrate the point further. And the execution is brilliant, with Kaufman's usual non-linearity - you never know exactly what's going to happen.
The casting is perfect. Great acting all around, and Rhys Ifans in particular does a marvelous job here. You can also spot Hillary Duff as a younger Lila.
And finally, pay close attention to ending. Hilarious.",8.0,2008-12-12,1,1,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0
0219822,0689324,jdab,"Not brilliant, but worth seeing","I was surprised that this film did not get more studio support and promotion, namely because it is thought provoking and it contains a couple of Hollywood stars. While I agree that this script isn't as enjoyable as Charlie Kaufman's earlier work on Being John Malkovich (but then again, what is?) it certainly contains its fair share of surreal comedy moments.  The sight of Rhys Ifans' Puff being trained to make witty comments at the opera or his father screaming ""Apes don't kill their presidents!!!"" just killed me. For me, Human Nature's greatest faults and virtues lie in its attempts to say something about what separates human beings from other animals.  Every day we all control our natural urges to conform to the rules of human society, and not always for the best.  However, I don't think the film was entirely successful in making its statement, perhaps because of the need to keep the audience laughing.  Also, while the performances of Ifans, Tim Robbins, and Miranda Otto are excellent, Patricia Arquette seems to drag down a lot of the scenes she appears in.
All in all, this is an original and funny film with a few flaws.  I give it 7.5 out of 10.",,2003-02-12,1,1,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0
0219822,1817683,jwoods90,A Fanciful Yet Insightful Film.,"This film really looks at the struggle of one's self to either adapt to society's standards and thrive in the modern world or indulge in the primal urges of our instincts and primitive emotions, but from a point of view so as to not put the viewer off with its message. The whimsical method of the storytelling in the movie combines a subtle, almost childish sense of humor with an underlying angst that is almost too faded to notice. If you enjoyed childhood tales like Jack and the Beanstalk, this modernized fairy-tale will appeal to your inner child, but make sure you don't overlook the underlying message, or you might miss what makes this flick deserve a second look from anyone tired of the ""same old same old"".",8.0,2008-02-10,0,1,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0
0219822,7629586,t-89079,Taking action project 2022,"The documentary Human Nature gives the people an idea of how technological revolution could reshape our planet and the human population itself. It opens the eyes of people to curing diseases, reshaping the biosphere, and being able to design our own children. The documentary starts off by interviewing a boy whose struggle with sickle cell anemia might be ended by these new therapies. It shows these new technological advancements such as the CRISPR. CRISPR is a technology that can be used to edit genes and, as such, will likely change the world. The kid explains to the people that he does not want to treat his sickle cell disease because he does not think he is going to be who he is without it. This new technology would let us even genetically engineer our kids to be someone who looks nothing like their parents by altering their genes. Technology is advancing at a rapid rate especially in the medical field with all these new devices. Especially during this time when we are in a pandemic it really demonstrates the power of medicine and how far we have come with all this technology. The film explains its the latest discovery will lead to a host of life saving treatments for debilitating or terminal illnesses. There's also a dark side to weaning out illnesses, because the same process may be able to help parents change what the scientists in the documentary refer to as the germline. Germline is the basic DNA that gets passed on through the generations. This would mean they would be able to change genes in their children that they did not like, and it may even be for the worse. This could lead to different gene mutations that would lead to different traits that we don't want. In the documentary there's a big question of who really gets to set these boundaries. The film does not ignore the potential for failure in order to convert the recent findings as a miracle cure all. The science and technology iis still in its infancy stage, and the documentary doesn't just breeze over the repetition of issues and history of setbacks. Technology is never always going to be in our favor. There are going to be those times where we create this new technology and it is going to hurt us more than we can gain from it. We can also see from the film that some of these new technological advancements we come up with are going to be taken the wrong way and abused by some people. The movie really opens up your eyes to where technology can go and become in the near future. It also really makes you reflect on the technology we have already created, on how we have even gotten to this point and what we could do more to increase our productivity and innovation towards technology and medicine.",8.0,2021-12-09,0,1,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0
0219822,0689326,mgbesq,More Pretentious Kaufman Blather...,"The credit ""Written by Charlie Kaufman"" is on its way to being the
new ""Produced by Lawrence Bender"" or ""Directed by Peter
Bogdanovich.""  What once was an exciting prospect, has now
been run down by the credited person's own inability to reproduce
past glories.  'Human Nature' is so weak, so dull, and so...insipid
that I don't really know how to start.  I know!  I'll write a comment
about how hard it is to start writing the comment to this movie!
That ought to really get the Kaufman fans in a dither!
Anyway, this movie tries to say big things about humanity and
nature and instince vs. culture, blah blah blah.  Hey film makers!
I'm out here!  I'm looking for some entertainment, not a 96 minute
anthropology thesis with boobs.  How about you all just back away
from the typewriters and coke long enough to make a movie for ME
the audience member and not just for your 8 friends who think
you're funny?
Geez, this movie really sucks.  I guess if you have to sum it up, I
guess it's a modern take on the Greystoke legend (that's Tarzan
for you young'uns), but substituting the adventure and compassion
for quirkiness and ironic snobbery.  Oh, and masturbation.  Always
crucial to fine film making is adding compulsive masturbation to
the lead's character arc.  I would recommend renting this movie if
you hate yourself or the people you're with.",,2003-03-06,0,5,2025-04-02 09:14:01,0
