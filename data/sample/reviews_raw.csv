tt0029583,rw10402293,Ozero_Zaisan,Garbage,"Snow White remake set out to modernize the classic fairy tale, but it ultimately leaves audiences disappointed. The film fails to stay true to the original story while also struggling to establish its own identity.
First and foremost, the lifeless script is a major issue. The characters lack depth, the dialogues feel artificial, and there's no emotional connection with the audience. Key elements of the fairy tale have been altered, but rather than making the story more engaging, these changes strip it of its essence.
The performances aren't particularly impressive either. Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White lacks charisma and inspiration, making the character feel ordinary and at times even unlikable. Additionally, the characters replacing the seven dwarfs are weakly designed and serve no meaningful purpose in the story.
When it comes to visuals and production quality, the film is shockingly mediocre for a Disney production. The CGI looks cheap, backgrounds feel artificial, and instead of creating a magical atmosphere, the movie ends up looking dull and uninspired.
Ultimately, this film feels like Disney turning its back on its own legacy. It doesn't come across as a loving modernization of a beloved classic but rather a project driven by political correctness with little artistic vision. The result? A failed adaptation that neither satisfies old fans nor captivates new audiences.
Another remake where Disney continues to kill the magic of its classic animations...",9.0,2025-03-25,2744,279,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0
tt0029583,rw1732734,Mightyzebra,This film is a magical spell which many have fallen under.,"Based on the Brothers Grimms' fairytale, this film is about a princess called Snow White who is looked after by her cruel stepmother, who is an evil witch. As long as the witch is the ""fairest one of all"", Snow White will be safe...
An indescribable amount of people love ""Snow White"", probably as their favourite film. Millions of people have fallen under its captivating and entertaining spell, loving the film in every way.
This, is indeed a very beautiful film, with memorable characters and very detailed animation, especially for that time. This film also has its laughs and is very cute.
No wonder so many people have fallen under ""Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs""'s spell! Although, surely there have to be other films out there that people could love just as much, or maybe even more?
This is not the best film in the world, but it CERTAINLY isn't the worst and everyone who watches it will like it in least one way. This film was also the start of the Disney company's fabulous line of animated films, good and less good.

tt6208148,rw10402663,rsspjcwh,Not sure why they bothered,"Saw this at the cinema with my six-year-old daughter. She laughed at a few scenes but whispered, ""this is boring"" about forty five minutes in. Watched the rest but we were both happy when the movie ended.
For me, the CGI was distractingly bad. I wasn't aware of the issues the film had with casting prior to the release but they should have either gone with actual actors or spent more money. It's worse than you think, and it's not just the dwarves, the forest and other scenes are poorly done.
A couple of the songs were catchy but by that point I just wanted the credits to roll. Acting wise, I guess the actors had to work with what they were given, but they seemed disconnected and going through the motions. Snow white's lines sounded forced and uncommitted. A better actor might have played the role more believably but again, she had to work with what she was given. I think though, the original film had an innocence this actress didn't grasp or was unable to portray.
Really, this movie seemed more like a 'direct to video' movie than a large budget Disney production. I've seen better CGI in small budget television shows and far better acting. Maybe miss this one unless your little ones really want to see it. Even then, maybe wait for it to be free on a streaming service.

The lead actress has no charisma and is not talented to work on classics like Snow White. The screenplay is poor and filibustering.

tt0029583,rw2909541,flickershows,Vanity Run Amok In The Land Of Weirdos,"The Queen should've just looked into her mirror---and stopped listening to her mirror---to see that she is indeed fairer than Snow White. I mean, judging 76-year-old cartoon characters on the basis of hotness is kinda creepy, but I'll risk creep accusations. The Queen is a babe. Too bad she's a murderous psycho who's obsessed with winning a beauty contest. It's like she's trying to one-up her mirror. ""I'll show you who's more subjectively beautiful, you glass devil!"" We're all a little vain sometimes, but don't you have a kingdom to run, lady?

Not that the dwarfs are above reproach either. They're sitting on a fortune in gems and they aren't even spending any of it to improve their lot in life...or the lot of those less fortunate than them. Plus, they tend to wallow in filth. Geez, what a motley cast of characters. Snow White is one of the shallowest movie characters in history, but she should have just bailed on ALL these weirdos. Take the hardworking woodland creatures and split for Oz or Neverland or Belize.

But I do love this movie. Irrationally, really. It's the dwarfs! Dopey is the cutest nitwit of all time and Grumpy is pretty much always right. Snow White DOES bring them misery and they would've been saved a lot of heartache if they'd just kicked her out. Still, it's sweet that even Grumpy relents. How can you not relent and fall for this gorgeous little trifle of a movie? The American Film Institute sure did, putting Snow & The 7 on five of its Best Of compilations, including both of the ""100 Years, 100 Movies"" lists.

So, yes, the Queen is evil and everyone else in this movie is absurdly pure at heart, but I still think I'd like to live under the Queen's reign. Apparently she spends most of her time gossiping with a mirror and not, you know, doing her job. You could get away with murder, maybe even step-daughtericide! The Queen herself almost does.

tt0029583,rw10410434,HuntinPeck80,1930s - was it really a more innocent time?,"The lampoons, the snark, the mockery, the chorus of disapproval. Snow White Rebooted (not its official title) of 2025 has had such opprobrium heaped upon it, no doubt well deserved, that I found myself suddenly curious to see the 1937 original. I'd never wanted to before. Never saw it as a kid. Maybe I was just curious to see how far we have fallen as a species since those more innocent times.
Were they more innocent though? 1937. Before Pearl Harbor. Between the world wars. The dawn of Disney. The origin point. The first animated feature length movie, isn't it? But this was, basically, the same generation that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima, the same US of A, right? Maybe just as Reds and Blues today regard each other as different species, maybe there was a duality of sorts even then? The human heart is a mystery, is it not?
Anyways, I was tickled by all the 1930s booty twerking going on (very innocent twerking), and it was a pleasant surprise to discover this film has operetta stylings, with coloratura trilling by Snow White, crooning by the prince, and a post-prandial party full of yodelling dwarves. All the forest creatures have the cutesy Bambi look, but I don't mind telling you, when the princess got scared in the forest so did I, and when she fell down weeping my heart ached for her. I also don't mind telling you that I did wish the movie would move along just a bit faster. Just five minutes. A bit more witchy Queen, a bit less tiptoeing dwarves, that would have suited me.
The Evil Queen is a marvellous meanie, and the princess Snow White is so adorably, queasily wholesome, so pure it makes you want to vomit (or possibly to ennoble yourself and become her protector?) that I felt some appreciation of why Alvy said he preferred Snow White's nemesis (in rom-com Annie Hall, 1979).
Seeing this chaste, landmark (birthmark!) fantasy, this jewel of cinema, one can better comprehend the shamelessness, the utter hubris of Disney's foolish decision to, ahem, 'update' the story for today. As I'm sure you know, Snow White 2025 was pilloried and lampooned, almost to oblivion, months before it even opened. What a saga it has been. A gift for social media snarks, but one can't blame them. To decide to remake an immortal classic is the kind of decision that could only come from the sort of people who are today busy crushing all the dreams in Hollywood's dream factory. Let them all be sacked and float away down river, eke out there remaining days in the wilderness; no fairytale cottage, just a one-room cave for the lot of them.

Here's why. Even at the age of four I saw the blatant sexism. Snow White is constantly having to be saved by a MAN. From her evil mother, the hunter has to let her go, the dwarfs have to shelter her, and finally the Prince has to bring her back to life.

She submits to cleaning for the untidy, unkempt dwarfs. She breaks into houses. She also can obviously not listen and understand logic. I always found her to be stupid. The girl eats an apple from a stranger after being told by the dwarfs that the Queen has many tricks and not to talk to anyone unless they were there.

tt0029583,rw3533242,Realrockerhalloween,And they lived happily ever after,"Mirror, mirror on the wall, who""s the fairest one of all? The Queen asks everyday to to her trusted enchanted mirror who always replies that she is until one day another name is given.

What I enjoy about Walt Disney's classic fairy tale is true beauty comes from within. The Queen is stunningly beautiful, but on the inside an ugly witch who wants nothing more then to destroy her step daughter who was pretty within, caring and sensitive. Snow White cares for the men who took her in, cleans their house, cooks dinner and pumps them up everyday before they go off to work in the diamond mines while her mother takes life for granted.

The visuals are stunning, the music enchanting and the characters enduring making it a true testament to filmaking with limited technology available at the time.

A problem I had with the story itself is the prince who was the only one not fleshed out or given personality and only there to serve as a love interest. He's bland, boring and perfect without any flaws making the romance feel a little rushed. The first half was exciting as Snow runs for her life, meeting her prince and the huntsmen's death, but it mellows out once she reaches the closet stuck with chores to do.

I was captivated by the evilness the Queen displayed with her suave body language, her shivering crackle and frightening transformation into an old hag straight out of tales from the crypt.

While there have been complaints from special interest groups on the artist merit of the picture and its portrayal of women I found her to be the most courageous, brave and daring of them all.",,2016-08-27,8,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt0029583,rw2848804,hpotter1397,The Fairest of them All,"No one believed it would succeed. Everyone called it ""Disney's Folly"". And yet, it was a giant money maker, grossing over $8 million, established its creator as a master filmmaker, and created a genre, changing history forever. ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""The Lion King"", ""Toy Story"", and ""Finding Nemo"" all owe to this movie: ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"".

Released in 1937 and re-released in 1944, 1952, 1958, 1967, 1975, 1983, 1987 (50th anniversary), and 1993, ""Snow White"" has charmed audiences for decades. But is it the classic everyone hails it as? Yes, it is. ""Snow White"" stands out as one of the best films in the Disney canon. We all know the story, so I'm not going to write it all out, just use IMDb's synopsis: Snow White, pursued by a jealous queen, hides with the Dwarfs; the queen feeds her a poison apple, but Prince Charming awakens her with a kiss.

The animation in the film is gorgeous, even by today's standard (save the Huntsman and the Prince, they look somewhat odd). Snow White genuinely looks like a young girl, and the Queen looks like a real woman. The way the Dwarfs are drawn is enjoyable, and so are the characters. Snow White is kind, cheerful, good with animals, and has a good personality (not to mention the fact she became a mother to the Seven Dwarfs - a tough job). The Dwarfs are all memorable and lovable, with Grumpy and Dopey being the most liked. The Queen is a great villain. Her drive to kill a young girl so she can be the most beautiful, which makes her go insane is incredibly disturbing and creepy, and the way she looks as the Witch is great. The film's music and songs are also perfect and memorable, with ""Heigh-ho"" and ""Someday my Prince will Come"" as the standouts. This is also perfectly paced, with sweet moments, scary moments, and time for character development.

So, what else can I say? Gorgeous animation, memorable characters, perfect music, and a brilliantly constructed plot. A true cinematic masterpiece not to be missed.",10.0,2013-08-10,7,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt6208148,rw10409482,Meknot,Is it that bad?,"Does this film really deserve the wave of criticism that has fallen on it? It's best to see for yourself, maybe not necessarily in the cinema, but it's worth giving it a chance and checking if this movie is really as bad as others say.
To begin with, a few positives. ""Snow White"" is an acting adaptation of the cult Disney animation from 1937. The plot itself has not undergone significant changes, although instead of the classic prince from the fairy tale we get Jonathan (Andrew Burnap) - a rebel who has to earn the feelings of Snow White. Thanks to this, their relationship is different from the original - we do not have love at first sight here, but a feeling built on emotions and events lived together.
The film also defends itself in terms of music. The songs, musical scenes and choreographies are well made, and the whole looks pleasant to both the eye and the ear. The humor is typically Disney - the dwarves provide a lot of funny moments that can amuse younger viewers (and even older ones).
Moving on to the negatives - the biggest problem is the acting. Rachel Zegler as Snow White sings great and is obviously trying, but her acting is more like a theatrical performance, which does not necessarily fit this film. Gal Gadot in the role of the Evil Queen is even worse - her performance is downright terrible, and singing makes things even worse. The special effects are at a decent level, but the dwarves are a big minus. Their appearance is a strange mix of animation and live action, which at least doesn't work for me at all.
To sum up - In my opinion, ""Snow White"" is a pretty good proposition for children who are unlikely to pay attention to imperfections - after all, it is a film aimed mainly at them. I myself had a good time at the screening, although I see its many flaws, it is certainly not as bad as the media say, but it is also far from being called very good. It is best to watch and evaluate for yourself, instead of being guided by other people's opinions :)",6.0,2025-03-27,116,608,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0
tt6208148,rw10388773,Bleu-Le-Fluff-0969,Another Unnecessary Remake of a Classic Tale,"Putting aside of all the political controversy and discussions revolving around the film, if we focus this remake as itself, still, it is really unnecessary and quite dull.
Disney has continued to prove that live-action remakes of classic animated tales are getting tiresome and unoriginal. Besides The Jungle Book and Pete's Dragon remake being pretty good, the other remakes have remained dull, baffling, or offensive. Snow White is one of those dull ones. Covered with excessive usages of CGI and colors, the camerawork, production style and colors feel bloated and unsocial. Alongside with the bland direction, uninteresting takes of how they tell the tale and where the characters were once beloved in the animated movie, becomes lifeless and uninteresting here. The choice of using CGI dwarfs really was a bad idea because it came off as quite uncanny and unintentionally creepy to observe at times.
The performances....aren't very great. Rachel Zegler does give her best as she does have solid moments including some of the voice performances from the other cast. Gal Gadot, however, her performance really didn't work at all. Gadot lacks the emotion and creep charm to what the Evil Queen should have been.

Marc Webb's direction could generously be described as a masterclass in mediocrity-an exercise in how not to reimagine a classic. His handling of the material was so devoid of creativity that even the most outlandish camp would have been an improvement.
The so-called seven dwarfs? They weren't authentic actors at all; instead, we were treated to a parade of CGI caricatures that failed to capture any semblance of charm. Their forced musical numbers were as out-of-place as a kazoo in a symphony-an entirely misguided attempt at infusing musical flair that only underscored the film's overall discordance.
Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White was painfully bland, with a performance that vacillated between uninspired and downright wooden. And then there's Gal Gadot as the evil queen-her performance, marred by a haughty arrogance, was as unconvincing as it was theatrically misguided. The chemistry, or lack thereof, among the cast only amplified the film's deficiencies.
Every element-from the poor acting to the mismatched musical attempts-conspired to create an experience that was both artistically bankrupt and humorously tragic. It's astonishing how a project can simultaneously squander a beloved tale and insult the audience's intelligence.

This live-action disaster-directed by Marc Webb-manages to twist a magical classic into a hollow parody that insults its own source material.
From the first frame to the final cringe-worthy scene, nothing about this film feels authentic or magical. Rachel Zegler's Snow White, instead of exuding grace or wonder, stumbles through a muddled script that seems more intent on pandering to modern gimmicks than honoring a beloved tale. Gal Gadot's Evil Queen, though a familiar face, appears trapped in an identity crisis that renders her both over-the-top and underwhelming. The production's relentless overuse of flashy effects and forced modern sensibilities transforms what should have been a timeless narrative into a disjointed mess-an exercise in creative misdirection that leaves audiences wondering if the director was aiming for satire or if he was simply out of ideas.
The film doesn't just miss the mark-it shatters it into a million unwatchable pieces. It's an utter waste of time and talent, a cinematic abomination that makes you question why any remake was even attempted.

tt0029583,rw2591767,jdn-hunt,Still the fairest of them all.,"The first of a growing cannon of classics, 'Snow White' epitomises the Walt Disney Company ethos of dreams coming true. The world's first feature length animated film succeeds not only as a masterpiece of filmmaking, but also in being the earliest representation of jokes and tropes that are nowadays a common cliché.
With an opening credit dedicated to the perseverance of his team of animators and various other personnel, the enormity of the task that was Walt Disney's original ambitious endeavour is clear in its first few frames. Everything audiences take for granted in the new millennium of computer wizardry and computer generated effects marks a milestone in his earliest classic, from its sheer length to its lasting beauty.
The movie's charm never relents, but is also genuine and never overbearing. The story is simple, yet efficient and effective. 'Snow White' is a condensed vessel for the studio's genius, every shot brimming with creativity, a timeless labour of love that proved how all that would follow might be possible.
Walt Disney's vision is never compromised, from references to gore through terrifying sequences of hauntings and witchcraft. It's this determination to make people laugh, to make them scared, to take them on a journey that makes 'Snow White' a wonderfully immersive celebration of storytelling.

The story we should all know. You have Princess Snow White - perhaps the most stunning cartoon woman ever? Not only is she beautiful, but she's extremely lovely and pleasant. If she existed, she'd be the next Princess Diana or Mother Teresa. It seems that everyone who meets her grows soon enough to adore her. But not everyone loves our dear Princess. Her wicked step-mother hates her and is terribly jealous of her. That's because Snow White is thought to be the 'fairest in the land'. So the Queen plans to have her killed by a Huntsman. When this plan fails, Snow White runs away and finds a place to stay - the house of 7 utterly lovable dwarfs! In a short time, they are completely crazy about her and love having her around. She's the ideal woman! But the Queen discovers her plan has failed and decides to take matters into her own hands...
It's a very simple but thoroughly captivating story. The characters are superb and wildly likable. They are marvellously given life by the great work of the cartoonists and the actors who voiced them. This is an excellent collection of some very fine voice actors, especially Adriana Caselotti as Snow White. She sings like an angel and her innocent voice is very lovely indeed. The music is well suited to the story and memorable, particularly the infamous 'Hi Ho' song.
The fun bits are fun; the serious bits are serious; the awful bits are awful; the feel-good bits make you feed good. 'Snow White' doesn't seem to do anything by halves. It's a truly charming gem of a film. I can hardly praise it enough. Walt Disney didn't put a foot wrong with this one. It was Walt Disney's first full-length film and in my opinion it will always be his finest hour. It's a masterpiece of entertainment. It even had me shedding a tear at the end! It's just a brilliant film - a classic. Few films have or ever will be as good, original and ground- breaking as this one.

tt0029583,rw1144806,Quinoa1984,"the Dwarfs steal the show, but there's much to see in this ground-breaker of cinema","To call Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs a classic goes without saying that practically everyone has called it such. It is a great film, but there are certain factors that make it so, and without them the film could've gone the other way and become important more for its technical breakthrough(s) than for the content. The fact is a story with the utmost simplicity like Snow White, the chief characters- Prince Charming, the wicked Queen/witch, and of course Snow White- are all very basic, simple, if not one dimensional than basely two-dimensional characters. It's appropriate, to be sure, as it is based off a Grimm fairy tale. Despite the beauty and charm of the early scenes, its really on par entertainment-wise with the Silly Symphonies Walt Disney produced in the 30's.
This also goes without saying that Snow White's run through the woods is one of the highlights of the film, still bringing a sense of terror and the surreal for the adults in the audience (if you're a little kid it could be one of the scariest things you've ever seen). But then- just as Snow White settles into her little 'hide-out' in a house she thinks occupied by messy, orphaned children- we're introduced to the seven dwarfs, and this is where the film picks up most of its energy, laughs, and complete and total balance. In a way, not to analyze too deep for a filmed fairy tale, they each represent the different sides of men, and so it gives the film the appropriate human dimensions it needs (in this, also setting up practically all the hand-drawn Disney films of the next seventy years or so). It's tempting to say which are my favorite, or whom I got the most enjoyment out of. There would be three, two for more obvious reasons, one for subtle ones.
Dopey, who is almost a perfect re-incarnation (in Disney Dwarf form of course) of Harpo Marx- he's a lovable idiot, with barely two sounds in the course of the film, who (and I hate to sound sappy) brings out the laughing kid in anyone. Grumpy, who I found to be maybe the most complete character in the film, has attitude to spare, and gets comic bit after comic bit happen to him from the animators- and yet, there is heart behind him, and when its revealed in key parts of the film, they act as the most emotional points. There is also Sleepy, who also barely says a word, but who's physical movements are really divine little moments among the big, inspired musical numbers. Indeed, there are little moments throughout the film that help make up the greatness: the mood and atmosphere in the Queen's dungeon of witchcraft; the scene where the dwarfs go to sleep (a fly that rests on Sleepy's nose); the traits given to the animals in the forest (that little turtle is hilarious).
All these parts help to add to the basic structure of the story- Queen wants the good looks, goes after her once the hunter fails, gives her the poison apple, then it goes even more predictable from their (though in a good way). The detail of the animated scenes, the backgrounds, the visual effects, are often mesmerizing. And the songs, which were some of the most standard I heard from the Disney oeuvre as a kid (they were always on those Disney 'Sing-along' videos) are still whimsical most of the time. Then there is also the icing on the cake- the voice of Snow White, Adriana Caselotti (who got contracted into this being her only film role, based of producer/uncredited director Disney's insistence), brings something to the film that's hard to describe, except to say that it's, well, serene.
Even if she's not the strongest character, her main goal of making people around her feel good and inspiring happiness makes her watchable, and in a way lovable. It's a very curious, though important, factor that she (and Prince Charming and the Queen pre-witch) are animated very traditionally, apart from the cartoon-like dwarfs and animals. Its a reminder of the film's, and Disney's, strongest success- that as an imagined and visualized fairy tale, the representation is strong, and touching. In the new century studios move away from hand-drawn animated films, but it's a good idea to look back to the early Disney films, if not for just nostalgia (or to watch with your kids) to get a sense of the experimentation, the purity of it. It remains one of only several animated films, from any country or style, to have the crucial elements come together- music, voice-talent, usage of colors, and cinematography.",10.0,2005-08-07,28,3,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

tt0029583,rw2451387,LoneWolfAndCub,A milestone in cinema...still the greatest animated film of all time,"Having just picked up quite possibly the last copy of the recent Diamond Edition of this film, and watching for the first time in 15 years, I am compelled to write this review. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is 74 years old this year, and it doesn't feel like it has aged a bit. What everyone thought would be a flop is the reason we have the likes of Pinocchio (1940), Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), The Lion King (1994), Toy Story (1995) and Tangled (2011). This film blew away audiences back then, being hailed as one of the greatest cinematic achievements and even being proclaimed the greatest film of all time by Russian director Sergei M. Eisenstein. The amazing thing is, Snow White blew people away when it was re-released in 2001 in the Platinum Edition, reminding people that the older Disney movies are timeless, and will never be topped.
Adapted from the Grimm Fairytale and made family-friendly, Snow White follows the story of...Snow White (Adriana Caselotti), who is proclaimed the ""fairest of them all,"" much to the distaste of her stepmother, The Queen (Lucille La Verne). A hunter is hired to take Snow White out into the woods and kill her, returning her heart to The Queen as proof, but having a change of heart, lets Snow White escape. She stumbles across an old house in the woods, which houses seven dwarfs.
The re-master is gorgeous, highlighting just how beautiful the animation is, and why hand-drawn will always be the best. The animals are cute as ever, the ""evil woods"" scene looks stunning, The Queen's transformation still frightening, and the final scene in the storm is just as epic as it was when I was five! I forgot just how many fantastic musical numbers this movie had, with ""Whistle While you Work,"" ""Heigh Ho"" and ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" sounding as good as ever.
This film spawned some of the greatest family films of all time, with Pinocchio, Bambi, Dumbo and Fantasia following straight after Snow White's success. As a 20 year old guy, I thought the magic may have worn off, but this film is a lasting legacy, a testament to the brilliance of these old Disney films. Watching this again, I found myself smiling at the antics of the dwarfs, singing to songs I'd long forgotten, and crying with the dwarfs over Snow White's body. Snow White has managed to enchant audiences for 74 years, and will continue doing so for as long as I can imagine.

tt0029583,rw3587188,Groverdox,"Great then, inadequate now","Disney's ""Snow White"" deserves its due as the first full length, sound and colour animated movie. I had a fear the animation may not hold up, but it still looks great.

The movie itself feels a little empty, though. It feels like there isn't enough story to make a full length movie: it seems to take a long time for anything to happen. The titular dwarfs don't make an appearance until much later than I had expected. Their uniquely descriptive names call attention to the only character traits any of the characters have. Snow White is hardly a character. Like the dwarfs, her name is a description; unlike them it is a descriptor of her appearance, not her personality.

""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" must have looked like magic up on the big screen in 1937 for adult and child alike, but nowadays there's just not enough going on on screen to hold our attention. The musical numbers, aside from the dwarfs' chant that everyone knows, are forgettable, it doesn't have any memorable characters, and the ending is underwhelming.

For classic Disney, I recommend ""Pinocchio"" for a better story and characters, and ""Bambi"" for atmosphere.",5.0,2016-11-27,4,27,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

She is called the fairest in the land because she is beautiful inside and out. She's kind, carring, and just wants to feel safe and loved; something anyone can relate to even today. Snow White is so likable and you want to see her live happily ever after. Like the original tale its a story that's build on emotion and how it makes people feel. Walt Disney was called crazy when he said he was making an entirely animated film back in the 1930's at that time animation was only done in short few minute segments so an animation the length of a film was unheard of. Walt went into debt and mortgaged his own house just to get this movie made and it went on to be a huge success and opened the door for other artists to make feature length animated films. I heard he had other ideas to add to Snow White which included the Prince being in the story more and needing to be saved by Snow White and her animal friends but at the time the animators didn't think they could draw what Walt wanted so it was cut.

Originality: (It's a remake after all)
Innovative artistry: There is no innovative tech, or anything that pushes movie making forward.
Emotional storytelling: While the singing is good enough to make you feel chills, in terms of story it just doesn't lands and feels emotionally flat. Maybe, grumpy amd sleepy get close to making you feel something, but it gets easily overshadow.
Attention to detail: The dwarfs look creepy and also weird when they are next to Rachel Zegler. And the other sub plot with the 7 randoms just make you feel like this movie was chopped in post by executives who intervene in the creative process.
Timeless appeal: The original was timeless theme, a kind hearted humble princess who was pretty on the inside and outside VS a jealous arrogant egocentric queen who was all about superficiality. This one is about a woman who wants to overthrow the government because she believes she is more kind than the queen. Very lazy and forgettable.
Sense of wonder: No imagination, you don't feel like you are exploring something you haven't seen before, it doesn't spark that childlike curiosity and awe about things that aren't real, but could be plausible.
Disney DNA died in the 90s. Ever since then they have been culturally and creatively bankrupt, and only survived thanks to all the acquisitions of far more creative and imaginative studios which they gradually are turning to trash.
The original snow white is still remembered almost a century later whereas the new one will be forgotten a year from now.

tt0029583,rw1744932,dolfin_phlipper,As good as (or better) than most Modern Disney,"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is often overlooked, for several reasons, including (but not confined to) ""it's sexist"", ""it's boring"", ""Snow White can't sing""...etc. However, in comparison to most Modern Disney movies, Snow White is brilliant. It was an artistic achievement in 1937, and it still stands up as a landmark in movie history. The story is (as most people will know), a princess is orphaned and is 'looked after' by her stepmother, who grows increasingly jealous of the young princess's growing beauty. The princess, Snow White, is forced to slave away for her stepmother, the Queen, until the Queen decides to have her killed. However, the huntsman chosen to do the deed cannot go through with it, and Snow White is forced to run away into the forest where she is taken in by seven dwarfs. All is fine, until the Queen realises that Snow White is not dead. Cue the transformation scene and the poison apple...and that's as far as I'll go.

Although the heroine is, admittedly, two-dimensional and the movie comes across as bordering sexist...well, it's a product of it's time. I'll leave it at that.

The fact that the beautiful animation can still stand up next to more recent Disney movies is an achievement in itself. And the fact that you can compare the two and probably say that Snow White's animation is superior is an even greater achievement.

The songs are beautiful, Snow White's singing *is* proper singing, she has more talent then many of the recent Broadway princesses put together. Product of the time maybe, but still outstanding. 9/10",9.0,2007-10-12,6,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

Set in a European-esque fairytale world, Snow White is the pretty young Princess living under the shadow of her evil stepmother the Queen. Envious of her beauty she orders her huntsmen to lead her out into the woods and cut her heart out. He gets the first bit right, but chickens out on the actual heart-cutting. Instead he banishes her to the woods where she promptly invades a private home, claiming it for herself, and enslaves the forest animals to do her bidding.
When the rightful owners return they are first alarmed but then happy to have a woman living in the house to seize their passions and cook their dinners. I assume that all dishes served in Casa De Dwarf are all vegetarian since we never actually see Snowy kill, skin, and butcher the animals that she has enslaved.
Eventually the Queen learns that Snowy is still alive and aims to kill her with a poisoned apple (that can be reversed by a kiss from her true love). Why she doesn't just slit her throat or burn the house down is beyond me.
There are not really enough developments in the story to maintain the 83-minute running time, with a lot of space devoted to singing and rhythm-timed animation in the style of Silly Symphonies. But the animation, and especially the backgrounds, are wonderful to look at and really do create an atmospheric, beautiful world. It's a shame Disney didn't indulge in them more.

It's amazing how much work went into making something so detailed and classic, since it first came out in 1937. To someone who doesn't know about rotoscoping, this would almost look better than modern animations. The artists' skill is really shown by how smoothly the characters move and how brightly the colors are used. There's a lot of great moments, but I think this movie ultimately lacks content to make it feel complete. The children will like this for its simplicity but mature viewers will want more depth and will finish watching the movie wanting more. The prince that goes after Snow White and the man that the hag hired to kill Snow White were heavily underdeveloped and ultimately didn't amount to anything. This lack of character development made some parts of the story feel rushed. The prince had some sort of ending although it was very lackluster, but the assassin just disappeared, never to be seen again. I would've liked to see what happened to him after he betrayed the hag's orders. His fate could have added an interesting twist or moral lesson. The ending of this movie felt like the midpoint, I thought there would be a whole nother act that will take another 30-45 minutes to conclude the movie, but the movie suddenly ended. Nevertheless, I still liked all the characters and the animation. The charm and humor of the dwarfs, in particular, were one of the best parts for me. This is a fun movie for families to watch together.",7.0,2024-12-17,1,4,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt0029583,rw2739732,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,My Favorite Disney Classic Film,"There are just some things you just can't beat and Disney's version of Snow White still can hold its own to many other animated fairy tale films that are being put out today. In this animated feature film, there is absolutely nothing that any viewer can't adore. The main premise of Snow White is still the same; the queen wants her dead and she wishes to be the fairest of them all. But in Disney's first ever to be released film, there are a few other added ideas to the story that make it a true Disney treasure.
Let's begin with the characters first. Adriana Caselotti plays the voice of Snow White. Caselotti's voice, when it is either singing or just talking, is wholesomely beautiful, sweet and cute and matches the way her character is drawn quite nicely. It is by far, one of the most amiable voices a viewer could hear. As for the Queen/Witch who tries to have Snow White killed, is voiced by Lucille La Verne. She too makes her character very memorable. Her cackle as the witch sent chills up my spine.
As Snow White flees from the Queen she also befriends a large amount of the forest animals; which all have the ability to some how understand her. But I really don't care because it is just as amazing to watch this movie now as it was for the viewers of 1937. But the supporting characters that everyone loves and remembers the most are the seven dwarfs voiced by multiple radio sensations of the time. And the great thing is, every fan has seven dwarfs to pick from to be the one they cherish the most. My favorite is bashful, just for being...well bashful. Tying his beard into knots and such. What a goofball hahahaha.
The other two great elements in this picture are the musical numbers and the animation. Whatever made the animation the way it was for its time, is truly something. I can't put my finger on it, but the animation is made in a way that not many other films were made in this category. This is probably due to the technology of the time. But none the less, this creates a nostalgic feel to the film. The same goes for the background music composed by Paul L. Smith.
Finally, along with Smith's score, are the musical numbers the characters perform. If it's the ""Whistle While You Work"", ""Heigh-Ho"", ""I'm wishing"" or any other song I can think of, all have really fun tunes and leave a lasting impression. Plus, they are fun to join in and sing along with as well. A very interactive film for its time and did wonders for Walt Disney's business. You just can't beat a classic like this one.
The Disney version of the Grimm brothers' fairy tale is colorful in animation, as are its musical numbers and lively characters. A true sense in the word classic.",10.0,2013-01-19,12,2,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

Movie Watched #1

Rating: 6/10.

Film watched on August 4, 2024.

Next Film: Pinóquio (1940)

I created this profile so I can rate films/series and make amateur reviews as I watch/rewatch them.

Rewatching this classic, I remember that the first time I watched this film I was already an adult and had already been enchanted, and now I'm almost 28 years old and I'm still enchanted by this film, but it's not a wonderful film.

The beginning of the film until the music of the dwarves washing themselves is very good, but then it gets very boring, with the exception of the parts where there is the Evil Queen.

My favorite characters in this film are the Evil Queen and Grumpy.

The only cool songs I think are Snow White cleaning the dwarfs' house with the help of the animals and also the song about the dwarfs going home.

Conclusion, it's a classic without a doubt, it's surreal to know that this film is from 1937 and they managed to do something so magical at that time, it deserves all the love and respect, but it does have its flaws, but the qualities stand out.",6.0,2024-08-04,1,4,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

I just find the characters really boring and that's why it's hard to really like any of them. Snow White is so delightfully sweet and just way too cutesy for my liking. She comes of as almost too flawless which is annoying. The Prince has no personality (or name?) except prancing around being romantic. I never found the dwarfs very entertaining either. I found them mostly annoying and I did as well when I was a child, so I never enjoyed watching this movie even when I was young.
The pacing of the movie is also a big problem for me. So much time is spent on walking around, looking at things, investigating at snail-pace. Fine if the characters look around the house for a while, but I swear Snow White sometimes stops for five minutes just to comment a chair or something.",4.0,2012-07-08,10,38,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

The movie even got a special price from the Academy Awards: One normal sized Oscar, and seven small ones! They didn't have a category for Animated Movies at that time, but its popularity was demanding much attention - and got it! It's a feel good movie that I remember well from my own childhood, but now in my old days I have some critiques. It's a good adventure, but it evolves as more like a musical, a type of genre that I normally greatly dislike. A few songs could have been skipped, and the choreography in the dancing scenes are too ""nice"". However, this fairytale from the brothers Grimm that I read as a child, was very exiting, and done good on the big screen. It has great animation with good colours and a marvelous depth in the frames. And the dwarfs are fantastic characters; all seven from Grumpy to Dopey.

tt0029583,rw2932917,Robert_duder,Setting the bar for animation,"Now I don't want any hate mail (just kidding I do...I love getting emails) but I am scoring this beloved classic a 6. Not because its a bad film, no movie that is considered a stone cold classic and the starting point of one of the biggest film heavyweights in history could be a ""bad"" movie but I review my films on entertainment value to me. I could list pros and cons for this film all day and all night because I feel like it has a lengthy list in both columns. On one hand if you look at it from its conception date in the late 1930's, it is brilliant, breathtaking animation. The artistic value on this film is a 20 out of 10. Still today you have to marvel at the beautiful hand drawn art and characters. But you could argue against me until you're blue in the face but I believe this is a movie that could have been told in ten minutes. They drag it out and there is many scenes in the film that are simply too long. Its an extremely dark film (as many of Disney's adventures tend to be) so much so that I personally wouldn't let very young children watch it. And while most of the songs are iconic and lovely, they are far from the best in the Disney animation classic repertoire.

Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs created some of the most iconic well known figures in animation history or film history for that matter. Out of all the Disney princesses I have always felt that Adriana Caselotti was the least impressive of the bunch. There are times when her singing voice is almost irritating like sandpaper and her tones are off in various scenes. I don't know why Walt Disney took such a liking to her but she didn't do much else outside of this so I think I may be closer to hitting the nail on the head than you would think. Lucille La Verne is very good as the evil Queen cementing her place in animated villainy quite purposefully. I felt like in this most recent viewing that she was actually almost underused in the film but she does get some terrific and terrifying scenes. Each one of the seven dwarfs are fantastic. They all have such unique (albeit blatantly obvious) personalities. Everyone will find their favourite and while some get more scenes than others, they are terrific. Harry Stockwell as the Prince...well I can't say much of anything about his performance because he is probably the most underused Prince in Disney history. There is no build up to their romance and every scene he is in is very rushed and forced.

That is perhaps my biggest issue with the film. So much of it dragged and too much time was spent trying to fill empty void in an effort to make it feature length and then when you hit the climax of her eating the apple...it rushes right through to the end and credits are rolling before you even know what happened. The last ten or fifteen minutes are far too rushed and compact. This film holds its credibility because of what it did for Disney studios and animation and the characters that became so iconic. The six directors that worked on this film deserve most of that credit because it really is a beautiful film to look at. Even the background of each sequence is just lovely. For me, it was a bit of a dud in a few ways but I can appreciate artistic beauty and this film is full of that at the very least. 6/10",6.0,2014-01-01,4,10,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt0029583,rw9197323,varbrkaka,The Most Beautiful of All?,"Let's start with the world's first full-length animated film.

I'll judge by my language (Brazilian), I've tried to watch it in the original language but the Brazilian dubbing is much better, I don't know the names of the songs in the original language so I'll write it in Brazilian.

It's really cool that the first line in an animated Disney movie and the world was given by a female villain, and she's one of the best female villains of all time.

The well music is very good.

I don't like the prince's music.

The first time I watched this movie was when I was already an adult, so I was never afraid of this forest scene, but if I had watched it as a child or teenager, I probably wouldn't have been able to sleep.

The music with the animals in the forest is very beautiful.

I always thought it strange that she invaded the house of the seven dwarfs.

Her song cleaning the house is my favorite song from this movie.

The song of the dwarves is unforgettable and memorable, I remember when I hadn't watched Snow White but I had already heard this song.

Grumpy is my favorite character from this movie.

I can't stand this song of them washing themselves.

Dopey is too cute.

The Evil Queen's transformation is wonderful. I don't like Snow White's song dancing with the dwarfs nor Snow White's solo song about the prince. In addition to breaking into the dwarfs' house, the dwarves still have to sleep in the kitchen.

""Are you thirsty? Take a drink"" I don't know how it is in the original language but in the Brazilian dub it's simply memorable.

Everyone knows that the Evil Queen didn't die and that she is the villain of another Disney princess.

The controversial scene of the prince kissing a ""dead"" child.

It is a charming film without a doubt.

Two wonderful songs only in my opinion.

Revolutionary for being the first animated film, but perhaps for almost 100 years since its launch, their mentality was very different, but just don't think that you can have fun and be moved by this film, which is still very beautiful.

There are lots of details in the animation, and it's so skillfully done that you feel immersed in it. There are also gags reminiscent of the ones in the Silly Symphony short films. I found them to be clever.
What bothers me about this movie is that Snow White is a very flat, undeveloped character. It's difficult to identify with her. For example, after she's been running through the woods terrified, she asks the birds for advice and they tell her to sing. So she does, and then she says, "" I feel better now, I'll be alright"". That kind of immediate recovery is really unrealistic. I find her perpetual cheerfulness to be grating, it's like she's not a real person. She never shows any real personal struggle or an obstacle that needs to be overcome. She just runs away to the woods, adapts immediately to living with dwarfs, and is completely happy even though she's just been threatened with death by the Queen and lost everything. She doesn't show any sadness, anger, or regret. It's a little weird...if a real person had that lack of reaction, I'd be concerned. The dwarfs are okay - cute but not very developed characters.
My favorite part was actually the animals. They're adorable and have a lot of personality. They are also responsible for helping Snow White when she was lost in the woods and after the evil queen tries to take revenge.",6.0,2025-01-21,1,8,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

What was once a timeless fairy tale full of heart and wonder has been stripped down to a dull, lifeless spectacle with none of the charm or magic that made the original so beloved.
The acting is flat and uninspired, with performances that feel forced and emotionally disconnected. The lead actress, in particular, struggles to bring any real presence or depth to the iconic role of Snow White, leaving the character feeling hollow and unrelatable.
Visually, the film fares no better. The animation and effects are shockingly subpar - at times reminiscent of outdated video game graphics. Rather than enchanting the audience, the film bombards them with artificial visuals that lack any real artistic vision.
But perhaps the greatest failure lies in the story itself. The narrative is scattered, lifeless, and entirely devoid of emotional resonance. Gone is the heart of the original tale, replaced by a rushed, soulless plot that seems more interested in ticking boxes than telling a meaningful story.
This adaptation doesn't honour the classic nor does it offer a compelling modern take. It's a missed opportunity - a hollow, joyless retelling that fails to leave any lasting impression.",1.0,2025-03-21,942,156,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

I have to tell you, those things they say about Disney and little kids are true. I have never seen anything since that affected me as profoundly. There was the sense of evil. The Queen with the mirror. The fact that she is sending a child into the woods to be killed. My gosh. I'm five years old and a child is about to be murdered. Then there are those little guys, each with a character trait to match his name. The story is one of vengeance. The queen transforming herself and then going on the prowl with those apples. The scene of her death is horrible.

And then there is a death experience. She lies in that crystal coffin. Will she be OK? Everyone was crying in the theater. And then, of course, the prince comes along. It's just a masterful telling of a simple tale with memorable characters, violence, and purification through suffering. When Grumpy cries...well I tell you.

tt0029583,rw2639857,djansen24,A milestone in filmmaking,"Snow White is a milestone in motion picture history. It is the first (and possibly the best) full length animated feature film. It spawned a whole new line of motion picture entertainment. It still sets the standard for animated features today. And it was a simple good story incredibly well told. Snow White herself is only mildly interesting. But give her a cast of quirky and funny side characters, and you've got a brilliant picture. Snow White does not focus solely on plot. It slowly moves along, giving room for the scenes of her interacting with the dwarfs and animals to draw us into to the atmosphere. We really get to know all of the characters well. The storyline may be familiar, but it is spiced up to create something fresh (compare it to taking ordinary soup broth and then adding a perfect combination of seasonings to make the best soup you ever had). Snow White also has some of the best music ever recorded. A lot of what Disney would later use to lesser effect in other films was birthed here: The animals who are there to give Snow White something to relate to, the animation timed out to song movements, the glorious foreground and background animation panels filmed to give a 3D effect. And the artistic detail rendered by hand in each frame is breathtaking. Only Pinocchio bettered this masterwork in terms of sheer artistry. The dwarfs naturally steal the show, but the scenes with the queen are given full weight in their creepiness. Not too scary but scary enough to send shivers down kids' spines.

tt0029583,rw0017057,White Dolphin,A Masterpiece only Disney could have conjured up...,"[May contain slight spoilers, but who doesn't know the story of Snow White?]

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is said by many to be the first and the best. The first feature length animated motion picture- yes, no doubt about it. As for the best, I'm not that sure. Don't get me wrong, I could definitely see why many people would say that this is Disney's best. For me it would be very hard to say what was Disney's best of the best but if I had to choose top 10 our dear Snow White would be amongst them. It's quite an extraordinary film, especially considering the time it was made. It features characters you're bound to bump into at Disneyland, the characters who perhaps shaped future Disney characters to come. First we have- who else but our heroin a girl with lips red as the rose, hair black as ebony and skin white as snow... did you guess yet? Of course this is Snow White, and no wonder from that description why the Queen, her stepmother is so jealous of her. The Queen in Snow White if you ask me is the coldest and one of the cruelest Disney villains to have ever roamed on movie screens. In fact she was deemed so scary that in England children under the shocking age of 16 had to be accompanied by adults to see this movie. You can clearly see the effect the Queen had on Disney villains to come, after the animators' lesson with her, no villain became as cold and scary and usually from then on the villains were accompanied by humor and sarcasm, which the queen does not have. No, she is out for Snow White and does not stop for jokes- how does Snow White dare be prettier than her?! I tell you if this Queen was to attend a beauty pageant I pity the other contestants. And so the Queen hires a hunter to kill Snow White but who (but the queen) could kill Snow White? Such a young beautiful and lovable woman? The hunter warns Snow White and off into the forest she runs and that forest scene is still one of the scariest Disney animators have drawn. Soon enough we meet the seven dwarfs whose names reflect their personalities. I always believed that everyone on earth has a bit of each trait of each of the seven dwarfs in him. There's Doc (the 'leader' of the dwarfs). There's Happy, Sleepy, Bashful and Sneezy (who I am often compared to seeing that I can probably get into the Guinness Book of Records for most sneezes). And finally there are perhaps the two most memorable of the little men- Grumpy, the grumpiest of them all and Dopey who can't speak, he never tried. Dopey is also the more childlike dwarf and the only one without a beard. But do you really think Disney could let Snow White off that easy? Nope, neither did I. The Queen soon finds out that the heart that her huntsman gave her was not that of Snow White, but that of a pig's. Well then, dear Queeny here will not let Snow White be prettier than her (even though she's living in a little house somewhere in the woods where the only people who can see her are seven tiny men... just shows how cruel this queen was). She transforms into an old peddler woman, the transformation being one of Disney's most unforgettable scenes. She tricks Snow White into eating a poisonous apple and just when all hope is lost Prince Charming comes and kisses her and she awakens and... they lived happily ever after.

Flawless? No, is there a flawless movie? I highly doubt it and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is no exception, but like many other Disney movies it has very few and rather irrelevant flaws. The biggest thing that bothered me was the simple fact that the prince was to effeminate (as was the one in Cinderella but Sleeping Beauty proved that Disney could draw a more masculine prince). The songs include Some Day My Prince Will Come (a song which many girls, I know have sung to themselves), Whistle While You Work (which many people have heard so much that they have forgotten it is from Snow White).

Where do I even begin? This movie is not just bad-it's a cinematic trainwreck that should be studied in film schools as a cautionary tale. Every aspect of this film, from the acting to the script to the direction, feels like a masterclass in how not to make a movie.
Let's start with Gal Gadot. Her line delivery is wooden, her expressions range from mildly confused to completely indifferent, and any attempt at emotion falls flat.
The script is an absolute disaster-full of nonsensical dialogue, forced exposition, and laughable attempts at drama. It's as if the writers Googled how to write a screenplay and then actively ignored every good piece of advice. The pacing is absolutely torturous. Scenes drag on for what feels like hours, yet nothing of importance happens. It's both boring and exhausting, which is a rare and unfortunate combination.
And then there's the direction. The action, if you can call it that, is a jittery mess, with rapid cuts that make even the simplest sequences unwatchable. The cinematography is uninspired, and the tone is all over the place-at times trying to be serious, then suddenly switching to unintentional comedy.
The final nail in the coffin is the sheer lack of originality. Every trope, every cliché, every overused plot device is thrown into the mix with no attempt at innovation. It's as if this movie was made by an AI trained exclusively on the worst action scripts ever written.
Simply put, this film is an insult to audiences. It's not just a bad movie-it's an unwatchable disaster. Save your time, your money, and your sanity. Avoid at all costs.

tt0029583,rw2656706,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,A timeless and unforgettable start of a great entertainment industry,"Before the beginning of the World War II in the 1940s, an entertainment industry was born and while most of the movies were made in the early 1910s and 1920s, a man named Walt Disney and several of his workers created a company known as the Walt Disney Company, a light-hearted entertainment industry, by releasing their very first animated full length feature, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" based on the Grimm fairy tale of the same name.
It tells the story about Snow White, a girl dressed rags who meets a prince. The queen, after becoming jealous of her beauty which will result in taking the queen's place as ruler of the kingdom, sends his huntsman to take her far into the forest where he can kill her. When he tried to kill her, he apparently lets her go after telling her of the Queen's plan. She runs into a forest, but after making some encounters with some forest friends, they take her to a cottage where she along with the animals clean it up. Little does Snow White know that this cottage belongs to the seven dwarf men, who then find her and decided to make friends with her and let her stay for as long as she likes. Meanwhile, the Queen, having found out the Snow White is still alive, transforms herself into an old hag and makes a poison apple so she can give it to her and will result in sleeping death.
For their first attempt at an animated feature that will lead to their success and create other classics, Disney has done a fantastic job and to me, I remembered watching this as a child and it finally grew out on me which is why I'm giving this a full 100%. The story is very original with an emotional feeling to it and the pacing is really good with some scenes that aren't drag. The characters are extremely likable. Snow White, although the weakest of the other Disney princess, is at least decent, the prince only appears in the beginning and the end, but was OK. The seven dwarfs are so funny. Doc, Happy, Sleepy, Grumpy, Happy, Dopey, and Sneezy are great and the hilarious moments with them are enjoyable to watch, but the only character who steals the show the most is the Queen who is by far a great Disney villain. Her motives are excellent and her old hag form scared the living soul out of me as a child. The voice acting for the characters are what I would like to say ""excellent"", but the strongest aspects goes to the memorable songs (I'm Wishing, Whistle While You Work, Heigh Ho, The Silly Song, Someday My Prince Will Come) and the beautiful animation I've ever seen in any film out there today.
Overall, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs will always remain to Disney-fans as one of the most classic films in cinema history before MGM would later do the same thing by making The Wizard of OZ, an adaptation of L. Frank Baum's classic book. This deserves a higher thumbs up from me!",10.0,2012-08-10,6,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

Continues to maintain the charm that Disney animation and storytelling is known for. From the beautifully animated character motion to the landscapes and rivers, each piece of this animated picture is gorgeous. While the style and storytelling hold up to modern standards, the thematic value is ultimately ineffective. Similar to many of the Disney classics, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs centers itself around the concept of love. At the start of the movie, the titular character Snow White is out in the courtyard when a beautiful ""Prince Charming"" introduces himself to her. Snow White runs off, but it is clear that she has been wooed by him. Unfortunately, the antagonist Queen watched on and became jealous of the affection, so she sent Snow White to her death. Due to the kindness of her hired killer, Snow White is allowed to escape and she eventually comes across the home of seven children. In an enjoyable twist of humor, it is revealed that they are actually seven old dwarfs who simply have the manners of children. The directors use this as a creative opportunity to teach kids the proper way to learn household skills like sweeping, washing dishes, and bathing. From this point on, most of the film is about Snow White and her love for the Prince. After the wicked Queen poisons Snow White for eternal sleep, the Prince heroically finds her, wakes her with true love's kiss, and the movie ends. For the past 86 years, directors and writers have had the time to build and perfect the concepts of love, so it is clear that this is an old film. In terms of the romantic substance, well there frankly is none. Snow White and the Prince barely speak a word before falling madly in love, and the connection between them is never deeper than ""true love."" Yet, no one expects it to be. In the end, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a funny, well-animated, and cute movie that is great for a little fun but shouldn't be expected to be a subversive masterpiece.",6.0,2023-04-24,1,12,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt0029583,rw2883258,OllieSuave-007,Classic First Full-Length Animated Feature Film.,"This is the first full-length animated feature film from Walt Disney. As a kid, I had wanted to watch this movie in its entirety for the longest time, and didn't get a chance to see it until it was released on video, finally, in the 1990s.
This film was better than I had expected, with catchy and sweet music (especially the Dwarf's Silly Song), memorable characters and beautiful sceneries and animation. This is what I think the best adaptation of this classical fairytale. Songs that you grew up with were probably introduced in this movie like Heigh-Ho and Whistle While You Work.
This story really portrays the gentleness, kind-heartiness, beauty and innocence of Snow White and the silliness, humor, yet selfless characteristics of the Seven Dwarfs. The movie also did a good job in portraying the mystery, eerie and horror surrounding the Evil Queen and her chamber full of black magic. The design for the Queen and the Magic Mirror is the best in any adaptation of this fairytale - animated or in real life.
This is the perfect film to start off a long list of Disney's Full Length Animated Feature Films. When comparing this film and the more current ones, you can see how far these films have come and the difference in style. While some of the newer films are great, others are sub-par, and none can surpass those films, including this one, that had Walt Disney's personal touch.
If you are a Disney fan or an animation/family movie genre fan in general, this movie is a must-see for you.

We saw no religious or other symbolism in the evil queen with the apple, nor did we see Snow White's name as anything other than what it was. Our impressive little minds were not tarnished by any stereotyping of the dwarfs or the ugly witch or anything else.

Not quite sure how comfortable I would be dunking on this though, because story and character wise, it really hasn't aged that well...but it is also the first animated feature film ever made, you know?
It's directed fine, the voice acting is fine, the dwarfs are kind of funny, the animation is still really great (even if Snow White can't keep her eyes open for whatever reason), the characters are all one-note as hell, yes Snow White is an utter dunce for eating the apple, the songs are all pretty bad (except the dwarfs' hi-ho, I like that one), and the animals are all adorable to no end.
In short, it's probably exactly what you'd expect from the first ever animated feature film. I understand they couldn't really do anything too complicated, because even this was a huge risk back then, so I'll cut it some slack, but I don't think I'll be remembering it as anything other than a really important milestone in animation.

With excellent humor, charming and very lovable characters (for the most part), and songs that still hold up today, Disney had succeeded in transforming animation into anything but a genre, which, sadly, is what most audiences think of these types of movies today.

Continuing my journey of watching or rewatching animated films and making amateur reviews with it.

This is the sixth film I've watched on this profile, it's not one of Disney Animation Studios' best but it was a great start.

I confess that I'm from 1996 and the first time I watched this film was as an adult, I already knew the base story, the dwarves' music and some characters, but because of my family's prejudice (which boy couldn't watch princess film), I only went to see it as an adult, and I was enchanted the first time I watched it, without a doubt it is the most beautiful film that Disney Animation Studios made while Walt Disney himself was alive, but it was not the best movie.

My biggest problem with this movie is the part where the dwarves are singing that they are washing themselves, my mind disconnects too much after that part.

Until this part, the film is wonderful, but then I lose focus and can't really enjoy the film.

I know it's a children's film, but I really don't like it. But even so, my favorite parts of the film are the Evil Queen's transformation and when she's coming down from the dungeon, she kicks the skeleton and asks if it's thirsty (I believe these parts are after the scene I mentioned about their little song if washing, but it's the only part I can connect to after that).

Favorite songs are the classics of the dwarfs and when Snow White is tidying up the house with the animals.

Brazilian dubbing is always amazing, it's practically another film if you watch it in the original language (in fact, it's worse in the original language).

I believe that Snow White is not even in my top 5 Disney princesses.

tt0029583,rw10306139,heyflp,"The Magic Around Her: Why ""Snow White"" Still Shines","""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" isn't a classic just because it was the first full-length animated feature in color with synchronized sound-it's a classic because Walt Disney understood that telling an animated story goes way beyond bringing the main characters to life. The real heart of the film isn't Snow White herself, who's a sweet protagonist but almost feels like a supporting character in her own story. She's there more to inspire the actions of others than to actually take action. What makes the film beat, what keeps it fresh and fascinating even today, is the vibrant universe Disney built around her-the quirky seven dwarfs, the Evil Queen with her sinister aura, and, of course, the enchanted forest that breathes, haunts, and dazzles in every frame.
Disney's greatest achievement was realizing that animation had limitless potential to create entire worlds. While most cartoons of the time were limited to quick gags with characters like Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, ""Snow White"" expanded the very idea of visual storytelling. Every frame is a spectacle in itself, packed with meticulous details that make the scenery feel like a living organism. The use of the multiplane camera was a game-changer: by creating layers of depth, Disney gave animation a three-dimensional feel, where the trees in the forest aren't just part of the background-they seem to lurk, reach out, and take part in the action. This visual dynamism transforms even simple scenes, like Snow White's frantic escape through the woods, into moments of pure, dreamlike terror, where the environment is as much a protagonist as she is.
Another brilliant aspect is the design of the supporting characters, especially the dwarfs. They're the soul of the film-not just because they provide comic relief, but because each one is a distinct visual and behavioral entity. Doc, Sleepy, Grumpy, Dopey, and the gang aren't just ""types""-their personalities burst through thanks to the exaggerated animation of their bodies, their unique mannerisms, and even the way their clothes move. This kind of physical exaggeration, centered on gestures and body language, is a hallmark of Disney's style, working almost like choreography that ties the physics of the animation to the essence of the characters.
The contrast between the dwarfs' lightheartedness and the Queen's almost gothic horror vibe is another of the film's strengths. The villain, with her angular face and imposing presence, is pure psychological terror-especially when she transforms into the old hag. The poisoned apple sequence feels straight out of a suspense thriller, complete with dramatic lightning and intense close-ups that ramp up the fear. The fact that the film doesn't water down these moments for its young audience is, ironically, what makes it so unforgettable. Disney knew that fear is part of the magic of fairy tales, and ""Snow White"" understands that enchantment comes from balancing the sweet with the dark.
Even with all its technical and aesthetic innovations, what really makes ""Snow White"" stand the test of time is its narrative rhythm. The film rarely lets a scene sit still. If Snow White is singing, birds are dancing along with her; if the dwarfs are marching home, each one has a walk that reflects their personality. This constant energy is what keeps viewers-kids and adults alike-completely hooked. It's a film that never settles for just ""telling"" a story-it lives it in every animated detail.
All in all, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" isn't just a historical milestone; it's a masterclass in how animation can be a complete art form. It's not just about nostalgia or paying homage to the past; it's a film that, even compared to today's cutting-edge technology, still impresses with its creative boldness. Walt Disney's genius wasn't in creating the perfect princess-it was in building a world where even a squirrel's blink or a turtle's stumble tells a story. And that's exactly why it lives on in our collective memory-a fairy tale that, ironically, survives not because of the princess, but because of everything happening around her.",10.0,2025-02-05,4,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

Though it isn't the oldest surviving animated feature (that honour goes to 'The Adventures Of Prince Achmed (1926)'), it's probably the most accessible; it's basically what you expect from a 'Disney' classic, which proves that they hit the ground running. 'Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs (1937)' is a Technicolor musical, based on a story by the Brothers Grimm, about a young princess who's forced to flee for her life when her vain step-mother orders her death. It's a technical marvel, with iconic imagery and complex animation, but it isn't the most compelling of affairs. Its plot is very light and its music numbers, save one or two, aren't really all that memorable. Still, the picture is enjoyable during its set-pieces and its pacing is about as tight as it could be. It certainly isn't the least engaging film in Disney's catalogue, though it isn't close to the most, either. In general, it's a surprisingly solid experience.

Was it exactly like the original? No. Was Gal Gadot able to prove to me she can act? Also no. But it's not as bad as people are making it out to be. Rachel Z sang beautifully. The dwarves were funny and nostalgic. And overall I enjoyed the new additions of songs. The script could use a little work but I think compared to some other Disney remakes this one managed to keep the magic and pay homage to the original songs it out it being a carbon copy.

Another area that needed improvement was the addition of the character Jonathan. I liked the bandit aspect but he felt one noted and I was distracted by his skater looking outfit.

Gal gadot should have never been casted in this or any film. She can't act and her monotone voice was annoying to me the entire film. That being said she looked spectacular in costume but they should have given her a prosthetic nose.

I loved the new song Waiting on a Wish. It felt very reminiscent of the 90s Disney films. The other new songs were not to bad but I really enjoyed the musical theater choreography of it all.

The best part of the film was 100% the costumes and set. I loved the colors and the scene where Snow runs in to the woods and makes her way to the dwarves house was especially impressive.

tt0029583,rw3396345,aileencorcoran,Snow White Review,"So, I've decided to watch and review all Disney animated classics, their sequels and TV shows. Naturally, I started with ""Snow White,"" which (prepares body armour) I'd never seen.

The story is based on the Brother's Grimm tale,and was the first ever fully animated motion picture, released in 1937. It was Adolf Hitler's favourite movie. The more you know.

Within, we have Snow White, a pale skinned, raven haired beauty who trusts everyone like a derpy puppydog, but is so nice you can't help but enjoy her. She is the prettiest in the land, much to the unease of her stepmother, the Evil Queen. Queenie orders her loyal huntsman to off Snow, but she is just so smexy and innocent that he balks, and lets her go. Snow runs through the forest in terror, only to come across some friendly animals, who guide her to a humble cottage owned by seven dwarfs. The dwarfs agree she can stay, and in return Snow offers to keep house. Everything is fine and dandy, until Queenie discovers that Snow is NOT dead, that the heart she requested is a pig's, so she magics herself into an ugly hag, creates a poison apple and sets off to do Snow in herself.

The story is simple, and Snow isn't the most amazing heroine, but she is nice. REALLY nice. She happy and chipper, yet quite assertive in the do-as-your-mother-says way. Her curiosity and innocence is both endearing and grating; her excitement over a tiny chair is just too sweet, yet her swooning over this hunky prince dude is just blegh, but maybe I'm just a cynic. Snow meshes well with her dwarf pals, and has a likable, soothing aura, which is saying something for an animated character. The dwarfs are good fun, and are easily the highlight of the movie. Each have their own distinct personality and each gets to shine through, hell they even look very different, kudos to that! They couldn't do that in the Hobbit where there was like, twenty of them? My favourite was Grumpy; I just love the old curmudgeon with the heart of gold. When he's the first one to jump on a deer to save Snow I was cheering on the inside, haha.

Where the film truly stands out is the animation and backgrounds. The colours, even though not as bright as the later Disney films, are still vibrant. The backgrounds are stunning, and I hope Disney do something like ""Bolt"" and bring painterly backgrounds in again. The animation is so smooth, and the musical and comedic timing is spot on, especially in the ""Whistle While You Work"" sequence, however they did that was amazing, it is easily the best part of the film for me. The shading is amazing too, the shadows and different tones make the film come to life. It's truly a moving painting. The music is pretty neat too, what with the score (was some of it reused or used in homage in ""101 Dalmatians years later?) and the timeless songs. Except ""Someday My Prince Will Come."" Oh my Lord. I'll take the same stance as Grumpy on that one! Overall, ""Snow White"" does hold up pretty damn well, especially in the animation and technical department. The message, well I'm not sure if there is one, but that doesn't matter much. I mean, Snow just barges into the dwarf's house and cleans up the place, she takes the apple from Queenie-Hag after being told by her new pals not to trust anyone. Yet there's the whole never judge the book by it's cover, listen to others, don't trust strangers and be patient. The ending where hunky prince charming comes along to smooch Snow had me thinking, is he like the Grim Reaper? Carrying her up to his castle on the clouds, while the dwarfs say goodbye? The ending was more bittersweet than happy to me, which is interesting.

""Snow White"" is truly a timeless classic, and a magnificent foundation for what was to come from Uncle Walt.",8.0,2016-01-16,4,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

I already know the story so nothing will be new to me, but one thing is true, it's still beautiful to this day. The first line of animations being from the villain is great. The Evil Queen is very sinister, I loved it. The well's music is classical and I don't like the prince's music. The music with the animals in the forest is cool. The animation of the water in this drawing is wonderful and it's been almost 100 years since the release of this film and it's still wonderful. My favorite song from that movie remains her cleaning the dwarfs' house. The music of the dwarves is magnificent too. Grumpy has always been my favorite and second is Dopey. It's cool Snow White figuring out the names of the dwarves. I can't stand the music of the dwarfs taking off, it's the worst in this movie. The Evil Queen's transformation is wonderful. I don't like their dancing music but I like Snow White's solo music. The ""death"" of the Evil Queen is memorable. Conclusion: even if you know the story of Snow White you have the chance to be surprised by this movie, especially with the animation itself, it's too beautiful. 90% of the songs are beautiful and memorable, the changes Disney made to the main story are wonderful, without a doubt the best version of Snow White to date.

tt0029583,rw3377758,Foreverisacastironmess123,"""A perfect disguise!""","In the name of Christmas, I dare to tackle Disney once again! Watching this

recently, I was struck by how simple and straightforward a watch it is. It really is the most simple fairytale you can get, and it seemed so much bigger when I was little. But nonetheless it still tells a great story of good and evil, wonder, and of course the happy ending, that's such a joy to get into. It looks like a storybook come to life and has such a charming quaintness to it that gets right in your heart and stays there! I can't help but marvel at all the endless rich small details there are in everything, there's such magnificent artistry on display here. The lush outdoor scenes, and the incredible realistic use of light and shadows. The animators took everything they learned from the wonderful training ground that was the Silly Symphonies and poured all of the best elements and techniques into this, and you can feel the spirit of what they were trying to express in animated form and it's beautiful and quite amazing. It's simplistic but it was their very first film. The next one though has a great complexity of emotions and dark undertones to it. Not by any means that this doesn't have its grim touches. Words such as dead kill death and blood are spoken, the excellent early scene where Snow White gets overwhelmed by her own fear and sees the woods as monstrous faces feels like a bit of a homage to the early more twisted animations of the Fleisher Brothers to me. There's the macabre prospect of an actual heart the Queen holds in an ornate box that's left to the imagination, and the climactic scene where the Dwarfs charge after the Queen - my goodness, they clearly mean to kill her! And finally when through her own doing she falls to her death very ominously. Snow White herself is so impossibly lovely and adorable that it's like she represents happiness and innocence. She's just a sweet singing girl in the woods with apparently a superpower to command the animals! You ask me if a person can watch ""Whistle While You Work"" without smiling or feeling lightened at all then they ain't got no heart... She has the voice of an angel and children have loved her for generations. Not to criticise too harshly, but I noticed that apart from supplying many cute and funny sight gags, the animals also serve the purpose of making Snow White seem larger as a character. And when it's not them it's the Dwarfs. And in my opinion it's actually the Prince who's the real cardboard cutout character, but that's not his fault! And ah, the Queen, if nothing else you couldn't say that she's not a proactive woman! I love her, she's so ice cold and commanding. Her malicious intentions to Snow White alone make her one of the scariest Disney villains ever, for she plain old wants her dead, simply for being too pretty! My favourite scene is the exquisitely animated sequence that skillfully builds the malevolence where the evil Queen concocts a potion comprised of the most menacing of ingredients to transform into a cackling old crone. Her disorienting transformation from second fairest in the land to hideous hag is like a formula created by Alfred Hitchcock. And as she turns around and reveals her new face, every child in the theatre was compelled to jump in horror. Very witch-like, right down to the wart on the nose. From an adult's perspective however, the before and after makeover is truly a trick and a treat. It makes me laugh every time when the crow is in the skull! The Dwarfs are what most people always remembered. It's in the collective consciousness because of them. In Gremlins, everybody knows what ""Hi-Ho!"" is! My favourite one is Grumpy because he pretends not to care, but he cares very much. It means something to me when he secretly blushes at Snow White's kiss, when he warns her not to let anyone in the cottage, when he cries out ""We gotta save her!"", and at that sad scene that's like a wake he sobs more than any of them at her supposed death. Good character, gruff and mean on the outside, kind on the inside. At the time before it came out they said that a feature length 'cartoon' couldn't work, that no one could emotionally connect to a character that was hand-drawn. How wrong they were. This film's true impact on popular culture is untold, I mean for one thing there wouldn't have been a Wizard of Oz movie without it, and that picture is a whole phenomenon in itself, nor would there have been a Disney legacy as we know it without the success of this film. It's certainly archaic, but to me it doesn't particularly feel like something that's pushing one hundred years, which is something that truly makes it, as Disney would say, timeless. The ""greatest folly"", ended up being the greatest triumph. I always love watching this, I feel the same way about it that I do about all the Disney films that I love, watching them is like 'going home...'",10.0,2015-12-22,4,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

tt0029583,rw1940859,tedg,Stained Glass,"I have a lot of complaints about Disney; what he made personally and the lumbering beast his studio has become.
In particular, he murdered one of the most precious literary structures we have in Alice. But in his first big project, he did well enough to change the world. In its day, this was a rule- changer, the Star Wars of its day. Everything that happened afterward was different.
Many people credit the characterizations, which Disney never did as well afterward, creating a vacuum for Pixar to fill. I admit that except for the ""swallow the soap"" trick, I liked that element.
But I think there is something more fundamental at work.
Movies are basically about visual notation. Its less about what the stories are than how they are told. One of the evolutions that I track is the business of outside awareness. But this, I think is something different, sort of in the opposite direction. We had comics before, where objects were not masses but boundaries. We had cartoons before, where large blobs of grey and then color defined shapes that we assigned identities to. But this has two things. They were revolutionary.
The first is the narrative long form. It isn't complex; it has only one arc. We even know what the arc is and how it will end, the only mystery (for the original viewers) being in the cinematics of the thing. Disney would stumble later, on understanding the nature of long form storytelling but here he does what must have seemed impossible.
The second is more visual. At the time, this seemed more natural and organic than anything that had gone before (except for the Prince  Disney always has trouble with men). We focus on the dwarfs, but the girl has mannerisms that are beyond anything we had seen before, the best being Betty Boop before the censors intervened.
But there's something deeper, and to explain it, we need some history. Light is magical. Reflected light isn't very special, light like you see bouncing off a magazine page. The colors you see are dimmer than real world colors because of the strength of the light of course, but what you see is what is not absorbed. You see the leftovers. In stained glass, the light comes through, directly from the source. The colors you see are more vibrant. Ancient glassmasters formulated glass that the moderns do not, so if you have a chance to see one (like the Tree of Jesse in Chartres) you will see millions of facets in each color because of the way that the color was layered on in a ""flashing"" process, creating refractive crystal boundaries.
These windows are a profound experience because of this scintillation effect that is subliminal. Like these old cartoons, the beings and objects are blobs of shimmering color with outlines that infer identity. Its a deep art that exists no where else, and not even since in stained glass.
Now another fact. Snow is not white. Snow is a collection of ordered microcrystals that refract light in all colors. The combined effect adds to white, but as you move ever so slightly, you will be receiving millions of millions of flashes of pure color. And now a final fact. In 1952, when I saw this on a huge screen, the screen technology involved faceted grains of silica that had this snow-effect of micro-refraction. Today's screens use microspheres, tiny balls with smooth surfaces, so the effect is not the same. And obviously digital screens are another matter. They all preserve this ""transmitted light"" effect of stained glass, as do all films. (But the new mastering of the cartoon for DVD does increase the purity of the colors, emphasizing the stained glass semiotics.)
I recently saw this on DVD, and was instantly reminded of the viewing 55 years ago, which washed over with a blizzard of snow scintillations with medieval weight, both in the story and the stained glass. I've never lost that thrill, and I wish it for you. This changed me and it changed film.

The CGI creatures replaced the dwarfs, but their lifeless presence couldn't rekindle the magic of the original. Visually, the enchanted forest was more plastic than fantastical, and Gal Gadot's Evil Queen, while stunning, lacked any real menace.

tt0029583,rw2974420,MissSimonetta,Still fair,"For all its historical importance, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) is not treated well by most Disney fans. It is tolerated, but not respected or loved. Common complaints fall upon the heroine being too passive, the music being too dated, too much padding, etc. No film is perfect, even great films, but my God, people are too harsh on this one.
No other Disney film possesses the innocence of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. It has a freshness, an excitement to it. It's as though you could feel the animators' joy in every frame. There is no hip irony or cynicism on display, no need to be subversive or cool. The whole thing is a fairy tale played straight and with tons of heart. It isn't hard to see why weary Depression audiences so readily took it to their hearts and declared it ""the happiest thing since Armistice"".
Snow White is not complex or super interesting as a character, but she has more of a personality than she is given credit for. She is also tougher than you'd think: she's a young teenage girl from an abusive home, yet she still believes she should keep a positive view of life and tries her best to stay optimistic through all her troubles. That's admirable. As for her warbling soprano, many will not favor it and yes, it is dated. However, don't be too harsh there. After all, I doubt the modern pop hit ""Let It Go"" in Frozen (2013) will gracefully age either.
Of course, the dwarfs are all lovable and entertaining. The Queen/Witch is chilling, one of the finest Disney villains. The Prince... well, he's rather dull. Honestly, I don't get the criticism of Snow's supposed lack of personality; she has it all over her prince.
The animation is still beautiful, even if there are a few awkward moments due to rotorscoping and experimentation. The muted color scheme is lovely, a great contrast to the exhausting bright colors which saturate modern animation (I mainly think of the garish Hercules (1997) or The Lorax (2012)). The backgrounds give one the impression of a children's storybook come to life.
Overall, this is a great film and we are still feeling its influence (for better or worse, since American animation is rarely allowed to leave the Snow White model). Without a doubt, it deserves more respect from modern audiences.",10.0,2014-03-05,10,2,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt0029583,rw10021605,miranda-23620,"First time watching it, and it's okay.","This is my first time seeing this movie, and I can see why it's highly regarded. The animation was smooth and very lively when it was made. As much as there was a lot of effort in the animation, I wished they did the same for the story. Of course, I wouldn't expect this movie to have thorough logic and a storyline since it was made for children. However, It shouldn't be an excuse when there are multiple children's movies and shows that can provide well-written storylines.

Well, first, we have Snow White, who is...boring. She's a very static character who doesn't exactly learns a lesson or changes at all. She doesn't have a motive other than being with the prince, which reflects how women were treated and how they were written in stories during the time. Yet, I don't find this to be an excuse because the Queen, who is another woman, has more to her character than the main protagonist. The reason she wanted to kill Snow White was out of jealousy. While Snow White just existed? This makes me question the message the writers were going for. A woman who makes her own decisions and doesn't revolve her life around a man is wrong? A woman with no motivation for herself and her whole existence is for a prince is good? I can see why they want to rewrite Snow White's character in the live-action...Yet this would take away her naive and kind personality, so to each their own in that debate.

I also thought it was bizarre that the Prince, who is only shown two times in the movie, falls in love with Snow White by just looking at her. The same can be said the other way around. And for the movie to paint this as ""true love"" is not a good message for children. Seeing a person only twice in your life and all you have to do is sing to each other does not exactly scream a strong foundation for a relationship. I can already hear most of you saying ""It's a fairytale! It's not supposed to be realistic or taken seriously!"" I am very well aware of that. Even fairy tales can be criticized.

Despite that, I enjoyed the movie. It's a fun movie that families can wind down and enjoy a good laugh. My favorite part of the movie was seeing the relationship between the dwarves and Snow White.

This film not only fails to recapture the magic of the 1937 original, but it actively strips away its heart and replaces it with uninspired performances, abysmal CGI, and a complete misunderstanding of what made Snow White a timeless story in the first place.

Rachel Zegler - A Disconnected Lead Rachel Zegler's casting was controversial from the start, but even putting that aside, her performance is uninspired at best and borderline indifferent at worst. Snow White is meant to be a kind-hearted and warm character, but instead, we get a version that feels distant and unlikable. Zegler's line delivery is flat, her expressions lack emotion, and worst of all, she seems completely detached from the world around her. Even her singing, which should have been a highlight, is overshadowed by dull, forgettable compositions that fail to bring any magic to the film.

Unconvincing CGI & Bland Production Design Disney has the resources to create breathtaking visuals, yet Snow White (2025) looks like a low-budget fantasy film from the early 2000s. The CGI animals are stiff and lifeless, the sets feel artificial, and the infamous ""dwarfs"" are so poorly rendered that they pull you out of the experience entirely. The enchanted forest, instead of being a place of wonder, looks like a generic green-screen backdrop with no depth or immersion. The costume designs are equally disappointing - Snow White's dress looks cheap and unflattering, and the Evil Queen's wardrobe does little to elevate Gal Gadot's underwhelming performance.

Gal Gadot - A Misguided Villain Speaking of Gal Gadot, her portrayal of the Evil Queen is nothing short of disastrous. While she certainly looks the part, her performance is devoid of menace or presence. Her delivery is stilted, her expressions lack nuance, and at times, it feels like she's struggling with the role entirely. Instead of being a compelling villain, she comes across as a half-hearted parody of better Disney antagonists.

Music - A Forgettable, Hollow Soundtrack Disney's animated films have always been defined by their iconic soundtracks, but Snow White (2025) completely fails in this regard. The classic songs that once defined the film are either absent or replaced with generic, soulless numbers that lack any staying power. Even Zegler's vocal talent can't save the uninspired melodies that feel more like placeholders than actual musical moments.

Final Verdict - A Complete Misfire It's clear that Snow White (2025) was not made out of love for the original story, but rather as yet another cynical attempt to milk nostalgia for profit. The film's lack of charm, warmth, and visual appeal makes it one of the most unnecessary remakes in Disney's long line of disappointments. The lifeless performances, awkward CGI, and dull storytelling make this an absolute chore to sit through. If you love Snow White, do yourself a favor and rewatch the 1937 classic - at least that film was made with heart.

I appreciate the expansion of the story and how it has been updated. Film begins by establishing Snow Whites background and early childhood, showing her parents positively influencing her. The wishing well is where you wish to find out who you can be, not a place to wish for a prince to someday come.

The eventual male love interest is not a prince, either, being more in the Tangled mode of ruffian with a heart of gold.

The animation of the dwarves and the mines is overblown, but a couple of the characters grow on you, in particular Doc, Grumpy, and Dopey, the later of whom gets some lovely growth as a character.

What I found unfortunate was the miscasting of Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen. She does not have the pipes for the songs she was given, which were forgettable.

As a whole, it is an improvement over the almost literal live action remakes of some of the other Disney animation classics. By updating the story, yes, being ""woke"", the 2025 version of Snow White justifies its existence.",7.0,2025-03-22,100,866,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

tt0029583,rw2543206,thesar-2,White's Right. Right Walt?,"(WARNINGThis is the Adult Disney Review Series. I have 51 Original Disney Cartoons to tackle, plus multiple – and forgettable – direct-to-Disney-Video misses. My goal in 2012 is to brave the task of watching all, many for the first time and commenting on eachall with an adult POV. Now, as soon as I can find an adult to do just that)

Ahhh Number one. Snow WHITE and the seven ""little men."" Like Walty Boy isn't trying to say something there. Don't count him out of adding subliminal messages throughout his works. And I'm not just talking about the Little Mermaid's Little Penis. I'm talking even smaller, as in using the phrase here ""Jiminy Cricket"" (repeatedly) or his hatred for things, well, not (snow) WHITE.

Admittedly, I'm not the hugest fan of this animated film. Sure, it's groundbreaking, for 1937, and against all odds, they made the first (of thousands) of feature-length animated films. Keep in mind: just because a movie's a milestone doesn't mean it equates greatness.

Example? Episode IV, A New Hope, formally just plain Star Wars. Sure it was ahead of its time, light-years, in fact, but wasn't it a fraction of the movie, Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back, formally just plain Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back?

Why was this, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, not the ""Great"" movie tons of critics attribute it to be? Oh, I don't knowbecause there's a lot of racism in here – from mocking the Chinese to the Native Americans? Because the lead singer (and voice) of Snow White sounds like she's sucking on chestnuts (not the dwarfs, I hope) whenever she opens her lips? Or is it the painful pacing?

That last one got me. Sure, they wanted to make the first full feature length cartoon, but it still felt like a couple-of-minutes-long short stretched far too long in most scenes. It is said, in the truthful, and masterful sometimes Walt Disney-HIMSELF!, commentary on the DVD, that Walt wanted only scenes that enhanced the character development. Unfortunately, it still felt like scenes dragged longer than they should.

I'll give it creativity. It's beautiful for what it was trying to be. It's also VERY adult. There's more than one scene of someone trying to kill someone else. Only, the Queen's evil plan was a little misconstrued. See, she sends her minion (apparently, she's just got one servant) to kill Snow White so the Queen can retain the ""Fairest of them all"" status. But then, she spends a good portion of screen time to transform into an ugly hag in order to trick Snow White into eating an apple and fall asleep. Luckily the writers caught the obvious flaw of a cure, but not the fact that there were plenty of opportunities for the witch/queen to simply stab the beauty instead of just putting her to sleep.

More things that irate me: Grumpy, apparently one of the ""main characters"" – due to a higher amount of screen time than many of the other Smurfs in the movie, is a dick. Plain and simple. Sure, he evolves and Snow White spends a good portion of the movie attempting to get him to like her. But, he's still a nasty character in any lighting. Also, the extremely over-dramatic Snow White is no princessshe never, EVER, shows appreciation for any of the nice things anyone does for her. I.E. the animals bend over backwards to find her shelter. She never, ever offers or says: ""thanks."" The dwarfs care more about her than themselves in many occasions, such as places to sleep or when she ""eternally"" sleeps, and when she awakes, it's all about her wishes. Bitch.

For die-hard Disney fans, it's a watch. It's not terrible; it's a good beginning and despite its flaws, I'm glad they (and the box office) had faith in Walty Boy to grant him further production deals, leading up to Disneyland, et al. Just don't be proclaiming it the ""masterpiece"" that people on the surface call it.

But you wouldn't have been able to be able to watch forty-three animated hits, plus many semi-cartoon classics like Mary Poppins if it weren't for the first fairy tale adaptation:

SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS.

You've got to like it. One must appreciate it was the first of its genre. I must admit I prefered Pinocchio (the second Disney classic which followed) as a child. And that's not saying Snow White is rubbish. It's a beautiful and jolly film. It's got a lot of good points, as well as bad points. Note possible spoilers.

The film opens as a white book helping set the scene that the Queen is vain and selfish. We then zoom into the Queen's bedroom in which see her see who is beautiful and if she's the sexiest woman in Cartoonland. Unfortunately, the Mirror says Snow White is. The Queen starts to show her evil by her bid to kill ther mysterious princess stepdaughter. The Queen's dialogue is beautiful, similar to that of Lady Macbeth (Walt did partially base the Queen's character on the Shakespearian villainess). The language is at it's beat in the transformation scene.

The next scene is where we meet Snow White. This is where the film falls flat. Snow White is a giggly bimbo with a freaky voice. If a pop singer had that kind of voice these days, she would fade away. Since when did Britney Spear's voice vibrate rapidly in a nausiating fashion? What's more, as the film progresses, the character gets even more nausiating. Snow White is even more stupid than the Mad Maddame Mim from Walt Disney's Classic The Sword in the Stone. In the last scene where she talks, she lets a strange stranger in, despite the warnings from the Dwarfs. And that didn't get her anywhere, did it now?

The Prince is equally as stupid. Unlike in Sleeping Beauty or The Little Mermaid, the Prince did not join in the Let's-Kill-The-Witch scene, which destroys his character as a Robin Hood hero and changes him into a lazy slob of a Prince.

The Dwarfs, on the other hand, are loveable and believable, mainly due to the fact that everybody is like one of the Seven Dwarfs. But my favourite character is the Henchman. By keeping him out of the story a lot, he is the only fully believable true-human character. Just shows how Disney works wonders with people, doesn't it?",,2003-11-26,6,2,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

The seven dwarfs are cute, comical and each of them as cuddly as a teddy bear - including Grumpy! Without the comic relief of the dwarven the movie would be a good drama.
Snow White has all the inner and outer beauty that a person could hope for. She's cheerful, helpful, charming, polite, friendly and fun. Quite a nice character.
Queen Grimhilde is the picture of all vanity. She wants to be the only beautiful woman in the kingdom. She is quite beautiful on the outside but she lacks the inner beauty that Snow White has which makes her more angry and jealous at Snow.
Prince Florian is a dashing and daring guy who has his eyes on the beautiful Snow White. Prince Florian is another ""Prince Charming"" and our hero of the film.

Of course as someone interested in movie history I had to watch it. In fact, I found a lot to admire about ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"". The animation is well done: Everything is moving fluidly, and it is evident that every single scene was designed with meticulous care. Human characters (Snow White, the prince and the queen) move naturally, whereas the dwarfs and many of the animals are comically bumbling. The colours are beautiful, and there are some charming ideas (the cuckoo's clock that contains a frog, for example). But still: the film is far from perfect, even by the standards of the 1930s. The plot is more than thin and drags in many places (for example, the dwarfs take ages to discover Snow White sleeping). Moreover, Disney needlessly cutified it: Snow White is not supposed to clean and tidy the house (let alone with the help of assorted animals), but rather to eat and drink of the food left by the dwarfs and to leave the room in a mess. But of course, a woman's role was cleaning, if not in the Grimms' early 19th-century Germany, then in the mind of Walt Disney. And finally: I simply dislike Disney's style of drawing. I dislike it intensely. That is of course no more than a personal antipathy, and I realise that someone brought up on this kind of material probably feels differently. Still, I could not watch the film with more than a kind of detached interest. On balance, 6 stars feels about right.",6.0,2022-12-23,0,8,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt0029583,rw10326735,ruy_peixoto,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937),"Review: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)
""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is more than just an animated film-it is a milestone in cinema history and one of Disney's greatest masterpieces. Released in 1937, this movie was the first-ever full-length animated feature, and even after so many decades, it remains impressive. I loved every detail of this animation, and I can confidently say that it is one of Disney's best works.
A Revolution in Cinema
First and foremost, it is impossible to talk about Snow White without acknowledging its technical and historical importance. Until then, animation was limited to short films, and no one believed a cartoon could hold an audience's attention for over an hour. However, Walt Disney defied all expectations, investing years of work and millions of dollars to create this classic. The result? A film that moved audiences back then and continues to captivate children and adults today.
The visuals are incredibly well-crafted for their time. The animation was hand-drawn with an impressive level of detail, and the use of Technicolor brings each scene to life. The characters' movements are fluid, and the backgrounds are stunning, with a depth that few animated films managed to replicate until much later. The use of rotoscoping to give Snow White's movements more realism adds an elegance that makes her feel almost lifelike.
A Simple but Powerful Story
The story itself is based on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale and follows young Princess Snow White, whose beauty sparks the envy of her stepmother, the Evil Queen. Consumed by jealousy, the Queen orders her to be killed, but the huntsman assigned to the task refuses to go through with it. Snow White flees into the forest and finds refuge in the home of the Seven Dwarfs. However, the Queen discovers her whereabouts and poisons her with an enchanted apple, leading to the iconic scene where the prince's kiss awakens her from deep sleep.
What makes this story so special is how it is told. Even with a relatively simple plot, the film balances humor, emotion, and suspense masterfully. The forest scenes, for example, are genuinely frightening, especially for a child. The moments with the dwarfs, on the other hand, bring levity and humor, while Snow White's relationship with the animals reinforces her charm and kindness.
Memorable Characters
The characters are another highlight of the film. Snow White is sweet, kind, and full of innocence. Some people today might see her as somewhat passive, but that is part of her nature and the context of the time. She wins over audiences with her heart and kindness, and it's impossible not to root for her.
The Evil Queen is simply one of the best villains Disney has ever created. Her presence is intimidating, her coldness is terrifying, and her transformation into the old hag is one of the most memorable scenes in the film. Her death, falling from a cliff, is one of the darkest and most dramatic moments of the movie.
The Seven Dwarfs provide the film's comic relief and charm. Each one has a unique personality, making them easily recognizable and lovable. Dopey, for instance, is hilarious without saying a single word, while Grumpy has a subtle yet touching character arc, shifting from grumpy to showing he truly cares about Snow White.
An Unforgettable Soundtrack
Another aspect that makes this film so incredible is its soundtrack. Songs like ""Heigh-Ho"", ""Some Day My Prince Will Come"", and ""Whistle While You Work"" are timeless. Each song fits perfectly within its scene and contributes to the overall mood. The original voice acting is also outstanding, with Adriana Caselotti's (Snow White) sweet voice adding even more charm to the character.
Cultural Impact and Disney's Magic
The impact of Snow White on cinema and popular culture cannot be overstated. This film laid the foundation for everything Disney built afterward. Without it, we probably wouldn't have movies like Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, or Frozen.
Additionally, the movie helped solidify Disney's image as the home of magic and fairy tales. Many of the elements we now consider classic in Disney films-such as the princess, the iconic villain, and the unforgettable music-began here.
Final Thoughts
Ultimately, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is not just a movie-it is a work of art. It features stunning animation for its time, a memorable soundtrack, unforgettable characters, and a simple yet deeply emotional story.
Yes, some aspects might feel outdated, such as the protagonist's more passive role and the whirlwind romance with the prince. But none of that diminishes the impact and beauty of this classic. For me, it remains one of Disney's finest works and one of those movies that never lose their magic, no matter how many times you watch them.
If you've never seen it or haven't watched it in years, I strongly recommend giving it another chance. This film is the definition of Disney magic in its purest form and proves that even after almost 90 years, animation has the power to enchant every generation.",10.0,2025-02-16,4,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

Movie Watched #1

I'm going to start a profile so I can record my notes and some of my comments, I'm going to start by watching animation films from more famous studios and since Walt Disney Animation Studios is the oldest, I'll start with that one.

I'm currently 27 years old (I'm from 1996) and I remember that I watched this Snow White film for the first time as an adult, but I was enchanted and impressed how they managed to make something so beautiful back in the 1930s, it's even be surreal.

I think it's beautiful, the story and the characters are good, but since the first time I watched it, one thing that always bothered me was during and after the song of the dwarves washing, I think it gets really boring after that, except for the scenes of the Evil Queen.

Best songs (I don't know the names of any of them, but my favorites are) the song that Snow White sings when she's tidying up the dwarfs' house with the animals and the song of the dwarfs.

Best characters, the Evil Queen and Grumpy.

The Brazilian dubbing has always been good, although unfortunately we cannot hear the original 1937 Brazilian dubbing of this film, as it has been lost.

It's a charming film, very beautiful, but it's not perfect.

Every element, from the cinematography to the performances, captured the magic and wonder that made the original so beloved. The music, in particular, was a highlight, with each song feeling as though it belonged on a grand Broadway stage, elevating the film's charm and emotional depth.
Yet, despite its brilliance, some continue to insist, ""Don't touch the classics,"" as if adaptations somehow diminish the legacy of the original. Ironically, many seem to forget that Snow White itself was never a Disney invention but rather an adaptation of the timeless tale by the Brothers Grimm. Stories evolve, just as they always have, finding new ways to resonate with different generations. Dismissing reinterpretations simply because they dare to reimagine a beloved story is shortsighted and ignores the very nature of storytelling.
At its core, this film is not a replacement but a heartfelt homage-a love letter to the classic that respects its origins while breathing fresh life into it. It reminds us that the beauty of stories lies not just in preserving them but in allowing them to grow, ensuring they continue to inspire for years to come.",10.0,2025-03-24,28,575,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0

Just saw the digitally restored version on DVD. It LOOKS incredible with bright colors and beautiful animation but I still don't like it.
The story is sssloooowwww and the character of Snow White is given NO characterization at all! She's just SO sweet and SO innocent that you just want to hit her. The Prince barely figures in this. The music and songs were terrible! ""Whistle While You Work"" and ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" were (kind of) cute but way too sweet. Also they're sung at such a high pitch they could break glass! The dwarfs are annoying and obnoxious and act like a gang of badly behaved children. Their ""comical"" antics were anything but. Only the animals come across as nice. Also the sexism is horrific. Snow eagerly agrees to keep house for the dwarfs for no good reason whatsoever. Yet when the Prince awakens her she has no problem running off with him to be ""happily"" married!

A life of unhappiness based on hopes and dreams of an era which pre-dated ""Gone With The Wind"" Most of those who admonished this film don't have much of a clue the Herculean effort it takes to make the level of color and movement that is hypnotizing and solidified the 2D animation that had made Disney so popular. While I understand most the context of the story is dated, it still wants you to suspend disbelief. Keep in mind, the girl talks to woodland creatures. In Walt's mind, he probably thought no one is stupid enough to take this seriously. Not so, apparently. So, here's the thing...the message. What exactly is the message? Simple: envious, bitter people will do a lot to stop people with a dream. Yep, the people who dogged this film are those people. Must hurt to see yourselves portrayed as a joyless witch who is sicken by jealousy. It is your own demise.

The other message people seem to have a problem with is of waiting for someone to rescue you with...oh no...true love! Yeah, who has a problem with this? Same people who probably took the idea literally. Little kids don't understand what that means. They do understand that it means you have expectations for people. Honestly, most angered by this are the ones who are disappointment to family members who care about them. I pity those who don't see the wholesomeness of this tale. It's a fairy tale. And 2022 society spent their time sickened with so much cynicism they can't enjoy a little hope...and faith.

Love is a powerful elixir that battles ugliness and bitterness. It seems some people like to re-write this flick because it's cool to do so. I use to be like this. So miserable in others having dreams. Singing optimistically to the heavens that something will save them. It's not idiotic to do so. Turns out most of us are jealous of people who are this hopeful. If you decide to dissect this to a point of politics, you will never find happiness.

tt0029583,rw10026586,twilliams0000,There's no Snow in Snow White,"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) is Walt Disney's first full-length feature film and it is incredibly impressive as such. The animation is all so beautiful and incredibly smooth especially from the character of Snow White. All the small details of the film, primarily the scenes involving nature such as the sunset or the way the water flows down the river is truly a spectacle and a beautiful sight. Even when it rains within the film, the fact that each drop was hand drawn is incredibly spectacular. Although the story has some outdated beliefs, specifically regarding Snow White and her very passive character, I thought the main plot overall was compelling. That being said, I did feel that a lot of what happened within the film felt like it had no importance to the plot of the film, specifically the forest animals and in some cases the Dwarfs.

The sequence in which Snow White runs into the forest after the failed murder attempt by the huntsman was easily my favorite scene within the whole film. The surrealist aspects along with those jarring and popping images of the eyes paired along with the very anthropomorphic trees and logs made this sequence so clever. I did feel that that surrealist aspect that I was craving didn't really last long and almost the opposite occurred where even the Queen's magic didn't feel mysterious or interesting. Overall, I appreciate this film for its art style and what it has done for animation and film history in general but it is not something that I can see myself rewatching in the future.",6.0,2024-09-23,0,3,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

Positives for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937):
The hand-drawn animation looks beautiful and it still hold up to this day. The movie has a simple story that is executed to perfection here. I love all the characters whether you're talking about Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The Evil Queen is one of the best villains in the history of cinema. You get a lot of cute and funny moments with Snow White, the Seven Dwarfs and the animals. There are also moments that are genuinely scary and this was when Disney used to have balls. The movie is short and has excellent pacing. And finally, the ending to this movie is one of the best endings ever.
Mixed for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937):
The Prince has aspects to him that are very dated by today's standards, but they don't bother me.

tt0029583,rw10199813,jxr-84975,"Visually Striking, but Cliched and Outdated","Disney's adaptation of the classic tale of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is one to remember indeed, as it was a groundbreaking achievement of its time, in terms of it being the first full-length animated feature film. This film was basically the first way shown how animation could tell full stories and bring joy to an audience without human actors. People everywhere know Snow White and all the dwarves and every time songs are heard from the movie, it brings a smile to everyone's faces. Even though this film held significant importance in terms of the film industry, it really hasn't aged well in terms of the main message viewers get out of it. The story is simple, but it relies on stereotypical fairy tale tropes, as Snow White is depicted as a damsel in distress, waiting for the prince to come save her with the classic true love's kiss. Her character as a young woman, especially today, really can't be compared to the stronger Disney princess heroines who forge their own journey, such as Elsa or Moana. For its time period, it's totally understandable as to why we would see her in this way. The plot is very basic, slow, and all we really get entertained by is when we see all the musical numbers, and maybe the fight scene with Maleficent and the Prince. Despite the film's lovely visuals, it's very cliche, and probably something I won't be rewatching very often for these reasons. Nonetheless, it still deserves praise as it paved the way for other Disney animated features, princesses, and characters to come.",6.0,2024-12-18,0,15,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

In a clumsy attempt to ""modernize"" the classic, the film strips away the magic, charm, and heart that made the original a timeless masterpiece.
Rachel Zegler's performance, while technically competent, feels emotionally disconnected. Her Snow White comes off less like a dreamer and more like someone begrudgingly enduring a role she doesn't believe in. It's hard to root for a character who seems to roll her eyes at the very story she's part of.
The dwarfs-sorry, the ""mystical forest dwellers""-are barely distinguishable, both in personality and purpose. What was once a band of lovable, quirky companions is now a generic group of background extras with less chemistry than a high school science lab.
And then there's the writing. Bland, preachy, and painfully self-aware, the script is so focused on making statements that it forgets to tell a story. The dialogue feels like it was churned out by a committee more interested in Twitter applause than timeless storytelling.
Visually, the film is a mixed bag. Sure, there are some beautiful shots, but they're buried under flat CGI environments that feel more like a theme park ride than an enchanted forest.
Ultimately, this Snow White is less a reimagining and more a joyless rebranding. In its eagerness to prove it's not ""that old fairy tale,"" it forgets to be a fairy tale at all.
To all the bots who thought this was a ""wonderful"" movie, nice try.

It's not to say any actor(s) in particular are bad at acting, no, its that certain ones were honestly just bad choices because they do not fit the character they were playing. Additionally, very amateur costume design and makeup accross the board, especially for the main character. They could have made a much more beautiful dress while keeping it like the original and given her much better hair and makeup. It looked cheap, like a costume, as did other characters outfits. CGI is subpar and certain characters that should play a bigger role, per the original, are rather ignored altogether and given little in regards to dialog. Not to mention the terrible messaging to the, what should be, target audience. Overall disrespectful to the original, badly written dialog, bad flow, plot is a joke with many problems... I could go on.
I fully understand that remakes, especially live action, will inevitably have differences from their original. However, certain changes are not only unnecessary but they are disrespectful to the original and make changes that end up fudging the entire story altogether.

The worst part of this film is that the story takes painfully long to progress and this personality gives me a immense headache, to the point where I consider turning of the film.

The movie boasts of a score that you will love and come to respect. Disney's beginning was so good that you just have to dip your hat to the dream of Walt Disney himself. It features the depth of imagination from the Disney crew that has long be welcomed and has been their trademark for years, nothing beats the names of the seven dwarfs and their characters.
Before Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the Disney studio had been producing animated short subjects in the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was to be the first full length cel animated feature in motion picture history, and to be able to keep up with the high production cost of over 1 million dollars which is considerably high for any movie at all in 1937, Disney had to mortgage his house.
The plot foundation is taken from the Grimm stories of Snow White, and Disney's seven dwarfs twist is what stands in the memory most as the story of Snow White.
Disney's gamble at that time was seen as foolishness, with many trying to talk him out of it, but after the movie was done and the first viewing was over, not only did Disney get a 10 minutes standing ovation, he also received a full size Oscar statuette and seven miniature ones for his work, this was presented to him by 10 year old child star actress Shirley Temple.
It has also received many other notable recognition in its time, it is listed as the 34th greatest movie of all time in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) and it is listed in their AFI's 10 Top 10 animated Film, as the number 1 Animated film of all time. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs provided enough revenue for Disney to build his studio, and also provided enough for them to make another two animations, Pinocchio and Fantasia. Snow White is the first of its kind, and the great thing about it is that it is not just a celebrated mediocre of an attempt at something different, the movie is a good animation, one you will most enjoy.

This was the first feature animated film. At a time when everyone else was certain that the hand-drawn format could only work for shorts, Walt Disney knew better. It's impressively self-assured. Sure, a lot of the sight gags and jokes are what you would find in the brief ones. And it does kind of show that there really is not a lot of plot here. Like, if this had not been picked to be made into a one hour 22 minute length, and they purely focused on story, this could have been trimmed down to a mere fourth of that. But the different scenes manage to evoke different moods and all get something across, sometimes just introducing new characters, a dynamic we haven't seen already in it, or developing those. It doesn't feel stitched together, or like it is just trying to run out the clock.
Is it silly to signal to the audience that Snow White is good by showing her positively interacting with woodland critters, and that the Queen is evil, because even rats and ravens flee or? Definitely. Does it still work, to endear us to the former and render the latter horrifying? Absolutely! Some of the moral messages that it communicates are now regressive by today's standards.

And when you see a full-length color film, just for that simple fact, it is already a fundamental milestone. In addition to that, the not-so-easy adaptation of a story into something animated is quite good indeed. You have a smile throughout practically the entire film. I think that trying to make a critique without taking these details into account is a total lack of common sense and respect for this work.

Seeing all the never-ending controversies and multiple reshoots, I didn't had high hopes for it and well.........let's just get into the review.
Starting with the positives. I like that they fleshed out Snow White's character more by giving her a proper backstory and an 'I Want' song and Rachel Zegler's luminous performance was easily the part about the movie. Her gorgeous singing and chemistry with the other actors was a delight to watch. Andrew Burnap as Jonathan was a pleasant surprise. He was hilarious and charming and his chemistry with Rachel is great. Out of the dwarfs, Dopey was the highlight and I like that they gave his character more depth and surprise twist. The other dwarfs were fun to watch (not their designs) as well, particularly Doc and Grumpy. The costume design and production design were beautiful, the visuals were whimsical and enchanting particularly the forest and the dwarfs' cottage and the CGI animals looked adorable.
But the movie has some glaring issues that I could not look past such as Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen. Her performance feels so flat, boring and uninteresting and is far inferior to her animated counterpart. Nor is she any good at singing either which is a shame because her solo number ""All Is Fair"" is actually kinda catchy but she just ruins it with her awful singing. It felt like she was just there to serve looks and nothing else. Then there's the CGI dwarfs. Oh my!! They looked so uncanny valley something straight out of the Polar Express animation which was so distracting. The new songs, though decent, do not mesh well with the old-timey tunes of the original and instead feel like generic broadway pop numbers. And the plot feels messy as it is muddled with so many story beats that it kinda falls apart. It seems to have an identity crisis as it tries to follow the original story while incorporating its own plot points instead of faithfully adapting the source material. The love story was very uninspired and lacked depth. There are so many new characters added who serve nothing to the plot (heck some doesn't even have any dialogues) and were completely unnecessary. Despite the runtime being under 2 hours it felt like the movie dragged on particularly during the second half thanks to the pacing.
Overall, Snow White suffers from a messy plot, Gal Gadot's terrible acting and the uncanny CGI dwarfs but Rachel Zegler's luminous performance and the enchanting visuals makes it a serviceable film. Though it certainly isn't the fairest one of all.",8.0,2025-03-21,8,57,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0
tt0029583,rw1269629,evanston_dad,Longing for the Days of Hand-Drawn Animation,"Watching this first feature length Disney film is a reminder that today's slick computer-generated Pixar movies come at the expense of hand-drawn artistry. ""Snow White"" is horribly dated in some ways, especially apparent whenever Snow White herself breaks into that piercing, warbly soprano to sing some very familiar songs, but there are moments in this film that will take your breath away with their sheer beauty of animation. I especially liked the wicked queen, who's really scary, and not a jokey villain like those of Disney's more modern animated films. O.k. so a single attractive female shacking up with seven smitten men would make many an eyebrow raise today, but get your minds out of the gutter, people.
I can accept that technology changes, and today's animation offers many treats in its own right, but that doesn't mean I don't lament an art that has become by and large obsolete.

Snow White isn't my favorite Disney movie, but I don't think you can overstate its influence. I also acknowledge that it has its flaws--Snow White's submissive character and her squeaky voice are often criticized. I also don't think the songs are that great, but where I will defend this movie is in its storytelling. Yes, it is a very simple plot, but that is its strength. It relies on visuals and keeps things uncomplicated, which means that very young children can understand some of the action, even if they aren't able to follow the entire story arc. It's the same reason that the first half of Wall-E gets so much praise. Both have breathtaking visuals, also--they way that Snow White and the witch move is actually more interesting to watch, for me, than almost anything else in animation. I think I read somewhere that they were rotoscoped, which is a process that has been used before and since, but for me, this is the pinnacle of what the technique can do.

So many of the animated movies of the last 20 years are filled with adult-level in-jokes, sarcastic sidekicks, and rapid-fire pacing that plays to short attention spans. It would be nice to have more stories that didn't try to be so full of irony, and instead focus on the things that make a story truly timeless.",10.0,2010-02-26,6,1,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

People laughed and cried and were excited and were frightened. Walt received more money then he had ever dreamed of having. Today the film has earned more then $1 Billion!

One might wonder if its historical significane is the only reason this movie achieved its classic status. After all, it's a simple story and Snow White is hardly an exciting character, her presence is rather forgettable and most of her songs quite dull.
However, there are many memorable parts here that justify its success.
The first epic moment comes when Snow White finds out that the Queen wants to kill her, so she tries to escape by running in the forest where things aren't exactly what they look, a scene reminiscent of German expressionism.
The dwarfs add a nice comedic touch, the interactions among them provide lots of fun, Grumpy being the one that stands out. Returning home and trying to deal with the intruder is a great example, bath time is another one.
And of course the queen, a villain for the ages, she stars in the most iconic scenes. Her transformation to an old witch, the final showdown with the dwarfs, the preparation of the poison, giving the apple to Snow White, her exchanges with the mirror.",3.0,2024-03-13,1,17,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

This movie was already for feminism in the 1930's! It has a strong, beautiful, AND lovely woman in it! The best live action of Snow White that I've personally watched is the Once Upon a Time Snow White, because she took care of herself, but still believed in true love (I personally didn't like the character, but that was for her story arc). This Snow White just walked into the dwarfs, oh wait, nevermind, the magical creatures' cottage and just slept in their bed after almost getting killed by this random huntsman, which she convinced not to kill her. But when the dwarfs get home they were gonna club her to death, but she wakes up and is still nice to them. She cooks them dinner, BUT tells them to wash their hands otherwise they can't eat, and the dwarfs do. People have lost the actual meaning of feminism. You can be a strong, powerful woman, but also be feminine, you don't need a fu¢ki¡ng sword to be powerful and strong. I absolutely love the sight of true love AND a strong women! Like Tiana, she was independent and strong, but she still fell in love and there's nothing wrong with that. That's truly why people loved this movie, there's a strong, but loving woman as the main character. And the prince only kissed her because she would've died otherwise, so there's no need to demonize him. He's most definitely not the creep, if anyone's the creep, it's Snow White. She loved the prince after seeing him supposedly once, I'm sure it's a soulmates thing, but then she goes into some random cottage, not knowing who lives there. She's a bit of a creep/she's weird, but that's what made the story interesting and the movie is just amazing.",10.0,2023-08-27,6,1,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

This is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family with lots of humor, romance, and laughter. This story is told through classic characters. For a full-feature movie, there really aren't that many characters. Besides Snow White and the Seven dwarfs (Doc, Happy, Sneezy, Dopey, Grumpy, Bashful, and Sleepy); the only other characters were the Wicked Witch, the mirror (surprisingly having a personality of it's own), the prince and the Woodsman.
Like any good Disney movie, it's filled with lots of animals who behave more like people: Birds (Doves, Raven, Vultures, owl, etc.), bats, alligators, rabbits, squirrels, deer, raccoons, chipmunks, butterflies, rats; there is even a mouse, fly, and horse).
Of course, there are songs in good Disney movies as well. Famous songs from this movie are ""I'm Wishing,"" ""Whistle While You Work,"" ""Hi Ho,"" and ""Someday My Prince Will Come.""
A couple negatives in this movie: I wasn't partically too keen on the Prince. Snow White's voice was a bit annoying.
Some parents may want to be cautious of the Wicked Queen's scene. She mixes a potion and casts a spell. There are skeletons and skulls that were obviously human at one time.",10.0,2012-10-06,6,1,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

The animation is very beautiful and astoundingly better than what I thought it would have been at that time. The way water moves in the movie looks great. The character movement is smooth and looks great. It's just a very beautiful movie. Story wise it didn't really do much for me. The plot of the movie sees Snow White a pretty basic character moving into a house in the woods with the Dawfs. This is largely just used to set up some fun slice of life moments with Snow and the Dawfs which are fun to watch but nothing incredible. The queen villain was a fun character to watch as well despite being pretty basic but other than her I found the end of the movie very dull. It probably doesn't help that this is one of the most well known endings to a film so it's not like I didn't know what to expect but it's somehow more boring than I thought. The prince who rescues Snow White is barley present in the movie except when he kisses her at the end and he is shown briefly at the start. But he does nothing the entire movie. I genuinely don't remember if he is even named in the movie. He is such an incredibly dull character and the movie would have lost nothing without him. So it's baffling to see him be that important to the ending. Overall the movie is a fun watch for the animation and slice of life bits. But has little to offer outside of that.

tt0029583,rw2553475,Rectangular_businessman,Beautiful classic,"Personally, I think that most of the classic animated films produced by Disney are quite underrated. Many people dismiss those films, mostly because they consider them to be ""only for kids"".

In fact, it is not only Disney films: Many good animation films are ignored and labeled as kid's stuff, disregard of the quality of the histories or the visual beauty of them. Even in the recent year, with the success of cartoons such as ""The Simpsons"", ""South Park"", King of the Hill"" and even ""Family Guy"" (Though I hate that show), animation is still considered a ""minor"" genre, with the children always being considered as the main target of it. Personally, I don't care about those prejudices: I have seen many animated films and series during my whole life. Some of them were good, others were badSome were excellent, and also, there were some animated films that had more artistic value and were more mature than many live-action films, even those that are considered ""classics"".

And even when ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" it's a movie ""for kids"" (I prefer to say that it's a movie for the whole family) that doesn't avoid it to have many artistic qualities that could be appreciated by the adults: In fact, I have to say this is one of the most beautiful films ever made. Not only the quality of the animation it's incredibly good even by modern standards (Actually, the animation from this film seems much more fluid and ""alive"" than many of the recent movies made with CGI, with splendid sceneries, and a lovely use of colors) but also the story of this film, (despite that it could be considered way too simple by modern viewers) has a unique feeling of magic that not many movies have, being comparable with classic movies such as ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""The Thief of Bagdad""That ""magic"" is present in every single scene from this movie, where everything seems to be made with love and effort, an honest work made for the enjoyment of the audience, a quality that most of the modern movies have forgotten in order to became heartless product for the mass consumption.

They don't make animated movies like this anymore, which is such a shame. ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" totally deserves to be considered as a classic. This might sound strange, but personally I think that, even today, this movie is incredibly underrated, and deserves way more love than it receives.",10.0,2012-01-22,7,2,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

While the original tale of Snow White is a beloved story, endearing to both children and adults alike, this version seems heavily skewed towards an adult audience, but not in a favorable manner. It appears to be aimed at adults who harbor a desire to denigrate the original narrative rather than honor it. The essence of the original story, which captivated audiences with its charm and moral lessons, is utterly lost in this iteration. Disney, a studio renowned for crafting magical and timeless tales, seems to have missed the mark significantly with this production. The decision to produce such a film appears baffling, as it lacks the enchantment and whimsy that fans of the original would expect. Instead of evoking nostalgia and admiration, it leaves a sour taste, standing as an affront to the legacy of Snow White. The characters are poorly developed, the plot lacks coherence, and the visual aesthetics fail to capture the ethereal beauty synonymous with its predecessor. Overall, this rendition seems less like a homage and more like a misguided attempt that strays far from what made the original a masterpiece. It's a shame that Disney, with its vast resources and creative expertise, would choose to release a movie that feels more like a parody than a respectful reimagining of such a treasured story.",1.0,2025-03-23,223,45,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

It literally just goes: queen tries to kill snow white, snow white runs away, snow white hangs with dwarfs, snow white goes into coma and then snow white is somehow wakened by a kiss. The pacing of this movie was sporadic, too. Most of the movie just consists of Snow White and the dwarfs, just hanging out, and then literally 20 mins before the movie ended, we see the queen start to conjure up a poisonous apple... Then it starts to quickly burning through towards the ending.

I don't like how it doesn't even look like Snow White even knows the prince's name, but acts like she's heads over heels for him. I don't like how the movie dwells too much on certain parts-- like when the dwarfs were washing up... Did we really have to watch them bathe for that long?

The only good thing I can really say about this movie, is how much I really like the instrumentals and I love hearing the characters talk. That's it. That's not even something that pertains to this movie specifically, that's just something that pertains to every old movie because they didn't have the equipment to get better audio. The only thing this movie has going for itself is that it plays a historic part in animation history. I wanna excuse the lackluster writing with the fact that the movie was made almost a century ago, but you don't need to have (for lack of better terms) more modern equipment to write a good script. You just need pen, paper and creativity. I'm sure there are movies just about as old as this one, that have a good script. But yeah...

This is, in my opinion, the greatest animated film of all time. It is certainly the greatest animated film ever produced in the US. It's a remarkable piece of work and, for its time, a monumental undertaking. It was in production for over three years and cost close to $1,500,000, a massive amount at the time. It was a smash hit when it was released and won a special Oscar from the Academy. While it was nominated for its musical score, none of its songs were nominated in the song category.

The story is quite familiar at this point, so I'll briefly summarize it here. Snow White is a princess whose stepmother is a vain and vindictive woman, jealous of her step-daughter's beauty. When the queen's mirror declares Snow White ""the fairest one of all"", the queen plots to have her killed. The plot fails and Snow winds up coming to live with seven dwarfs, winning them over and taking care of them.

The queen learns that Snow still lives and decides to take matters in her own hands, poisoning Snow with an apple which puts her in a deep sleep. The queen is killed and Snow is awakened by her true love.

The animation is breathtaking and still looks great even after all this time. The songs and the score are catchy and memorable and the characterizations are excellent. This is a first-class achievement in all respects.

This film is available on DVD and Blu Ray and is well worth having. Most highly recommended.",10.0,2015-05-26,3,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

Although the story is simple, it does make up for that because of its entertaining characters. Thanks to Disney each of the dwarfs got a name and personality, something that was lacking in all the Snow White stories I have read in fairy tale books. The songs are unforgettable especially the hey ho song when the dwarfs go back home. As a kid I found the witch very scary and think she is the scariest of all the Disney villains.

tt0029583,rw9815127,Falko_h1,A groundbreaking classic with enduring charm,"""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" released by Disney in 1937, is a groundbreaking animated film that set the standard for future animations. As the first-ever full-length animated feature, it tells the story of Snow White, a princess who flees from her wicked stepmother and finds refuge with seven lovable dwarfs.
The animation, especially for its time, is remarkable. The film's hand-drawn artistry brings the enchanting forest and the whimsical dwarfs to life in vivid detail. The character of Snow White, with her kind heart and gentle nature, is endearing, while the dwarfs-each with their own distinct personality-add humor and warmth to the story.
The music is another highlight, with memorable songs like ""Heigh-Ho"" and ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" that continue to resonate with audiences. The film's blend of lighthearted moments and darker themes creates a compelling narrative that appeals to both children and adults.

tt0029583,rw3392345,Michael_Elliott,Historically Very Important,"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)
**** (out of 4)
The beautiful and charming Snow White comes under attack by a man who has been hired by the evil Queen to kill her. She ends up taking shelter in the forest with seven dwarfs but soon the Queen has more plans to destroy her.
There's no question that this is a legendary film and a very important one to history as it was the first feature-length film from Walt Disney Studios. The film was a tremendous hit when it was first released and it really broke new ground in regards to what people would be willing to sit through. After all, it was a mystery if people in 1937 would be willing to sit through a feature-length cartoon and whether or not they'd be able to show emotions towards animated characters.
As for the film itself, it's certainly a great one from Disney's original Golden Age. There's no question that the most impressive thing is how great the actual animation is. I've seen plenty of cartoons from this era and the quality is usually good but there's no question that the amount of detail was just taken to a new level here. Just take a look at how much detail is in the forest scenes. Look at the detail to the seven dwarfs. Look at the terrific detail in the Queen's potions.
SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS features a memorable and lovable lead character, a great villain and seven great comic relief characters. I also liked the fact that the darkness of the Grimm's Fairy Tale was also left in and this certainly makes the film more adult in a way.

tt0029583,rw2781338,Centaurus3,1st out of 5 in the Golden Age,"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the first Disney film, and the first animated film altogether.

The story is about a young teenager named Snow White who flees into the woods, and stumbles upon a cottage with 7 dwarfs, because her wicked stepmother is after her to kill her.

Even though this film was made back in the 1930s, it still holds up today. The characters are all intriguing (except the Prince), and you are rooting for the good guys. Snow White is a sweet, naive protagonist and even though she is not the most active Disney Princess, you want her to get her happy ending. The Dwarfs each have their own unique, and funny personality, and they are clearly the most interesting characters of the film. Queen Grimhilde is just so bitter and ruthless, and she does her job as a villain extremely well. You don't see much of the Prince, but he is an alright guy, and is good for Snow White.

The animation is pretty good for the time it was made in, but it does have a few inconsistencies, like the movement of the characters, but it was the first animated feature, so it's alright.

The story is pretty close to the Fairy Tale book, and is dedicated to that. There is no problem with the plot at all, but the filler scenes are a bit too long. All of the films in Walt's era has filler in it and that is alright, but in this film, it is a bit too long and some drag o. longer than its welcome.

The songs are brilliant and bring you up. Th classic songs like ""Heigh Ho"", and ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" add more depth into our characters and the story. Perfect

The main character, Snow White, played by rachel ziegler doesnt work for me either, she doesnt fit the role on any plane. She doesnt look like the Snow White of the original story and comes off goofy and annoying rather than lovely.
The story also doesnt follow the origional and not to the better, it seems to me this movie is an attempt to rewrite history.

tt0029583,rw10151801,Bluedragon-52876,A Monumental Achievement In Film History. The First Full Length Animated Feature Still Holds Up.,"In regards to cinema, there are numerous films that are considered to be works of art, and as a result, ultimately earn themselves a place among the most memorable of all time. What some might have difficulty trying to consider, is that animation can also be considered art. On the subject of animation, the first name that one tends to think of is Walt Disney, who is one of, if not the most famous individuals in such a field. In 1937, he would oversee the production of the first full-length animated feature film, which at the time, could be seen as an ambitious and audacious experiment. The end result, is a film that is by all accounts, an all-time classic, and one that has continued to be regarded as the standard for many animated features that would follow in the future.

Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs is a monumental achievement in cinematic history. It's a positively dazzling experience that proves that animation is indeed a form of art. As time goes on, it is inevitable that films will age, with some aging better than others. However, this film has aged perfectly, as it still looks as stunning now as it was back when it was first released, with animation that is among the finest that one will ever see. For a film that was released in 1937, it has aged perfectly, and still has a considerable abundance of staying power.

The film is based on the fairy tale of the same name, with some additions to it. Snow White is considered to be the ""fairest of them all."" This earns the ire of her stepmother, who plots to have her eliminated. However, things do not go as planned, and the initial attempt fails. With that, Snow White takes refuge in a small cottage in the woods. Before long, she ends up meeting the ones who live there, a group of seven dwarf miners, who eventually take her in as their guest. Conversely, the queen has other ideas, and in a further attempt to eliminate Snow White, decides to resort to measures that are far more drastic and eerie. The end result, is something that is truly spectacular, something that would not only help make Disney the company responsible for such animated gems, but something that would become a gamechanger for cinema on the whole scale. Even after nearly a century, this is a film that still holds up.

Like I mentioned previously, this excels on many levels. To start with, it's extremely impressive to look at, with the animation being absolutely astounding. Even by today's standards, the animation is both detailed and fluid. A few intervals that standout (in my opinion), would be the scenes whenever the queen is talking to the mirror, which show incredible detail, as well as the sequence where the queen undergoes a transformation to carry out her nefarious scheme, which is both stunning and frightening at the same time. In addition to the visuals, there's also a perfect balance between drama and comedy, with the dwarfs providing plenty of the latter, although, when push comes to shove, they come through in the face of danger. That's another trend that started with this one, a cast of interesting characters that are easy to get invested in, which is something that has also appear in many of Disney's classics.

As most are probably aware, classic Disney films are also known for the music. This one also started the trend of the debut of many songs that are among some of the most well known in the history of Hollywood. Written by Frank Churchill and Larry Morey, there are some absolute gems to be heard here. Among them include the classic ""Whistle While You Work"", which is definitely one of the most well-known songs in the catalogue. Another one would of course be the catchy ""Heigh Ho"", which is definitely guaranteed to make viewers want to get up and march around to it. And who could forget the outstanding ""Someday My Prince Will Come?"" These songs (like the film itself) are classics, and they would technically be a setup for the greatness that would be to come in the future.

To reiterate, Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs is a visual and technical delight that rightfully deserves its reputation as one of the all-time classics. When a film like this is still being held in high regard nearly a century after its release, it is a testament in regards to how much staying power it has. As time goes on, some films will age better than others, with this one definitely being amongst the ones that have aged beautifully. If there's any film that has perfectly withstood the test of time (whether live action or animated), it's this one, as it still holds up perfectly. And furthermore, it reiterates the idea that animation is a form of art.",10.0,2024-11-23,3,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

I remember watching it a lot as a kid, and I know that now the film is a little controversial when it comes to how it depicts women and what their role should be, but as a kid all of that flew over my head. I always enjoyed this movie, but I also didn't think it was good either. As I got older, the story just didn't do it for me anymore and I felt that it was boring. I also think it's weird that a 14 year old girl married a guy that's probably in his twenties or thirties. Of course, I didn't understand what was going on as a kid. Also, why couldn't the Evil Queen have created a spell to make Snow White ugly? Did she really have to try and kill her? I feel like there were many options she could have explored first in order to solve her problem. The dwarves have also always annoyed me. Yes, they are cute and fun, but I have always hated their dialogue, even as a kid. If I had to choose a favorite character from the film it would probably be the huntsman who was ordered to kill Snow White, because he didn't, and he was the least annoying character in my opinion.

There isn't much that hasn't already been said about ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" 1937 version, Walt Disney's first feature length animated film. Suffice it to say that it not only fulfilled the studio's hopes beyond their wildest dreams. The movie that made possibility of the Disney films that followed it. From the famous Grimm fairy tale about a beautiful princess who flees her jealous stepmother and finds refuge with seven friendly dwarfs, Walt Disney created a cinematic milestone. At the time the film was in production until the day it was released, rival producers were supposedly referring to it as ""Disney's Folly"".Although this myth has been recently debunked in film historian JB. Kaufman's magnificent new book (''The Fairest One Of All:The Making Of Walt Disney's Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs''Weldon Owen/Disney Press, 2012)it's true that only after it's huge success, did fellow movie makers attempt their own full-length cartoon features. Upon it's debut, at Hollywood's Carthay Circle theater, (December 21, 1937)the film was embraced both by critics and audiences, grossing many times it's then record (for an animated film) $1.5 million budget. Eight successful reissues have kept the movie in the public consciousness now for over six decades, during which time the field of animation has grown by leaps and bounds. Still. despite the cinematic advances and the passage of time, ""Snow White"" stands alone. While the classic story is but a framework for the film (a fact which troubled me for years), ""Snow White"" can be fully enjoyed for the pioneer it truly is.
Along, with a splendid cast of voice actors/ actresses headed by Adriana Caselotti (Snow White) Harry Stockwell (father of Guy and Dean, as the Prince) and Lucille La Verne (The Queen). Much time and effort went toward developing the characters of the Seven Dwarfs and giving each a distinct personality (absent in the original story) which went a long way in making audiences care for Snow White's plight. Interestingly enough, although the fairy tale was toned down considerably to make it more ""family friendly"", the overzealous way in which the film makers transformed the Wicked Queen into a hideous hag at the climax was the subject of an incredible amount of controversy at the time. In fact, it was under a partial ban in England which made it off-limits to children under 16 years of age!

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is based on the German fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm. It was the Walt Disney Studios' first full-length animated feature film, as well as the first American animated feature film in film history. The story is a familiar one: Raised by a wicked and vain queen after her royal parents died, beautiful Snow White is taken into the forest to be murdered. However, the huntsman cannot commit the horrible deed, so she flees and finds refuge in the home of seven diamond-mine workers/dwarfs: Doc, Happy, Bashful, Sneezy, Sleepy, Grumpy, and Dopey.

I never even realized then that the film was as old as it was.
It wasn't until the VHS was released later that fall with an introduction by Roy Disney that I realized the significance of the film. I enjoyed the film for what it was, I was a child and nothing seemed out of sync to me. But now, everyone is critiquing the film for every little idiosyncrasy. Who cares that they are called dwarfs? That's what they were when Grimm wrote the story, and no one complained until now.
The film is beautifully drawn, and the ink and paint is striking, especially for artwork done nearly a century ago. It's hard to believe that Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs will be 100 years old in just a short twelve years. Even at its age, it's still better than most of the CGI stuff now. There was love and care taken with hand drawn animation that can't be found today. I'm glad to have experienced this film long before the live action remake came along.",7.0,2025-04-09,0,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt0029583,rw8694882,brunovalsi,One of the best animated feature films ever made,"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is what i consider to be the most inportant animated feature film ever made, why? Because it's the first one ever made, and that's why it's historically important, but importance aside, this is a really good movie, in fact, it's a masterpiece, Disney's Golden Age movies in general were amazing with some even masterpieces, such as Bambi, Pinocchio, Fantasia, etc. And this is no exception.
One of the many things that make Snow White so great is it's animation, it's truly beautiful, the backgrounds are absolutely breathtaking, everything is just so meticulously drawn, the musical score is really good as well, it manages to capture the tension, lightheartedness of some scenes, as well as the fairy tale feeling. The songs are pretty amazing too, they're really memorable, some are pretty catchy, some are beautiful to listen to.
In terms of the characters, they're pretty entertaining too, i admit that i wasn't too crazy about Snow White herself but boy, do i love the dwarfs, each of them have their own personalities that make then distinct, and they're also pretty funny, especially dopey, they will really make you laugh, and i absolutely loved it every time they were on screen, and the queen herself is very intimidating, she doesn't really come off as a generic villain, her serious facial expressions and the ominous music that plays when she's on-screen really make her somewhat intimidating.
In conclusion, Snow White is pretty much a masterpiece, it started both the disney animated canon and animated feature films on a very high note. It's a pretty charming movie that doesn't have a specific target audience, it's for everyone.

That being said, this movie is yet another disappointing live-action remake in a growing list of unnecessary Disney reimaginings. The main problem here is the cast. Neither Rachel Zegler, nor Gal Gadot, nor Andrew Burnap can act very well. Plus, there are far too many songs, and I can't remember how any of them go. Also, Zegler sings like she's pining for a Tony Award, which is the wrong choice for this performance.

tt0029583,rw2522709,ElMaruecan82,The One That Started it All ...,"""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is the triumph of guts, imagination and talent, an outstanding mixture that only a visionary genius like Walt Disney could have concocted. He was told it was a folly that would bankrupt his company, no one would endure bright colors and little creatures fooling around on a big screen for more than an hour but since when do geniuses listen?
""It all started with a mouse"" loved to remind Walt Disney, as an encouragement for people to believe in their dreams and never underestimate the magical value of the smallest creations. The road for success is paved from these little ideas, visions and intuitions  even the iconic Mickey Mouse would have been named Mortimer if it wasn't for a precious advice from Disney's wife. And starting with his iconic mascot, Walt Disney established a real laboratory on the field of animation. It was the famous 'Silly Symphonies' era that brought up to screen so many enchanting cartoons, featuring animals, trees, flowers and music in the purest tradition of European storytelling. When you compare ""Flowers and Trees"", first animated cartoon in colors made in 1932, with the unforgettable ""Band Concert"", made three years later, you realize how impressive the progresses were but when you see ""The Old Mill"", 1937 classic masterpiece of realism, you immediately get the feeling of a crucial step finally reached, and asking for something more adult, more revolutionary
Mickey Mouse and the 'Silly Symphonies' contributed to the success of the Walt Disney company but what Disney needed was a flourishing empire, a bigger project that probably started with an innocent 'what if' question. Making an animated feature  think about it, in term of works, it's probably equivalent of making ten or twelve animated films with the same level of artistry as ""The Old Mill"" with the whole gallery of emotions we would expect from a film: thrills, laughs, passion, endearing characters and memorable songs. I make it sound like a 'business plan', but we're talking of the then highest grossing film of all time on which the whole existence of the Disney Company was jeopardized. If only for that, ""Snow White"" deserves all the praises for having been one of the most groundbreaking creations, on the same sensational level as ""Star Wars"", 40 years later.
And Disney couldn't have thought of a better story to begin with. ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is in total aesthetic harmony with the 'Silly Symphonies' (the setting, the presence of animals) and the drawing, especially of the dwarfs as cartoon characters, was the final step of what was developed during a whole decade by the Disney studios, inspired from the old classic European drawings that always had a sort of cartoon feel. ""Snow White"" stylish simplicity makes it appealing on a universal and timeless level. It can look old but never dated, and Disney proved his international ambitions by allowing the foreign animation studios to adapt the frameworks to their own language. Disney meant business
And the result is a triumph of both storytelling and perfectionism, Disney didn't think animation and made it into a film, he thought of a realistic film first, hence encouraged his staff to use classic designs to draw the face of Snow White, the Prince, and the Evil Queen, they might look very basic compared to Disney's following works but they're human enough to suspend the disbelief that we're watching a cartoon, an important element in order to catch the interest of the adults and awakes their inner child. And the film respected the viewer's comfort so much that the use of relief, perspective, zooming and lights and shadows was made in a constant attention to the smallest realistic details, and on that level, the making-of of ""Snow White"" is an inspirational encouragement for work and perfectionism, with dreams fulfillment as the pay-off.
Another interesting aspect relies on the character of Snow White herself, so unfairly mentioned as one of the least interesting Disney heroines, when her main interest was to be a foil for the dwarfs and the villain. The dwarfs prove how intuitive Disney was for his first film, as they allowed to provide a set of seven different personalities with an almost three-dimensional value, this is the fantastic trick of the film, try to watch the other versions of Snow White, and you'll see how cruelly lacking a personality the dwarfs are. It's almost impossible to think of them without visualizing Dopey, Doc, Sneezy, Grumpy, Sleepy, Happy and Bashful. And Snow White is the central of that universe, like the emotional core of the film that justifies the dwarfs' comicality, the Prince's passion and the Queen's evilness, another aspect of the film that provides it a timeless feel. The Evil Queen embodies the combination of beauty and vanity, she's so cold, she looks like a modern woman with an undeniable sex-appeal, and if one thing, she's the very proof of the Disney Golden Rule, there's no good Disney film without a great villain.
And thanks to a final and successful pacing, the rest is history and like every classic masterpiece, each scene of ""Snow White"" is a classic on its own, the forest with eyes, the dwarfs coming from home, the Queen's haunting metamorphosis, so many songs forever engraved in our memories, ""Whistle While you work"", ""Heigh-Ho"", ""Someday my Prince Will Come"" the party and a finale that would make all the people, kids or adults, in the world cry and laugh, and finally cheer  discovering the Disney effect, that for each laugh, there would be a tear, a feeling that would last for many decades over and over again.
Thank you, Mr. Disney for your contribution to the world of animation, film-making and entertainment!",10.0,2011-11-23,3,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt0029583,rw9012733,FKDZ,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs still holds up today and is a absolute joy to watch. A fairytale told in animation, color and stunning music. I finally got around to actually watching Disney's first feature animation film and it didn't disappoint.
First of the art is incredible, the matte paintings are mesmerizing and if there's a move you need to see twice it's this. Especially when more characters come on screen there's just so much going on, so much liveliness. There's something else you might notice. Considering the craft of all the hand drawn animation it's an art that goes by too fast for just 1 viewing, so I'm definitely looking to rewatch it.
I could write about animation, but we know. It's perfect. Just a thing I want to note down besides the excellent animation are a few aspects, like the timing of the animation to the music, the way all the movement flows with the beats of a certain song. It's so meticulous. Besides that, I love the little ''extras'' that Disney does that make certain things just that extra cute or funny. Like the bunny peaking around the corner after being scared, but then a second later also squirrel popping out between his ears. So many fun little moments.
Besides that though the music is what ties everything together and has to be my favorite aspect of the film. It synergizes all so well together and they are so fun, so joyful. But sentimental when needed. Everytime it kicks in I get goosebumps. Because it just becomes just a experience. Imagine seeing this movie in 1937, you'd be blown away.
The story. Mostly its good enough. But it does make some choices that make the ending feel rushed and underwhelming. We get a fairly thick mid section but the movie ends quick. And especially the prince is underdeveloped. Which makes the kiss have much less impact. Also the sudden switch to some text slides felt like budget was becoming an issue (I think this was the case, or I'm misremembering) So therefore it's not perfect. But it's so close. I can't wait to continue my Disney journey through the years, the good and bad. It's about time.

Most of the dialogue is straight up exposition where the characters explain to the audience what's going on and how their world works. The unwritten rule of movie making is to show, not tell. Explaining things we don't care about gets old fast, and they do a lot of just that.

tt0029583,rw3010226,gerald-koh99,This never gets old!,"Disney has made many animated feature films, and there are still animated movies aplenty being made out there in modern times, but very few can eclipse the very first one of all, which is the story of a beautiful young princess called Snow White who is under the watch of the wicked Queen, who forces her as a maid in the house. This movie is now so highly rated and acclaimed that in 2007, the American Film Institute named this animated flick the 34th best American film of ALL TIME.
Even while watching it as a little kid, watching it again as a grown up teenager still brings back awesome memories, proving that the story, the characters and beautiful music is gripping and makes this a fascinating tale. Snow White herself is drawn so beautifully that you can't help but simply admire her, and the incredibly adorable voicing from Adriana Caselotti is a child's fascination. The Seven Dwarfs are very united and usually do things together- they live together, work together etc. But they are all different in personality and even in appearance. One example is Grumpy, who is for a while reluctant to accept Snow White and cold towards her, but is still one to play a part to rescue her from the Queen when danger arrives. They are the other backbone of the story, and are my personal favourite in this.
This one animated film has received a lot of praise and attention over the years, right up until now 3 quarters of a century later, because by 1937 standards this is just phenomenal. Kudos Walt Disney for having the far-sightedness and innovation to create this stupendous movie in Technicolor back then and making it fun and realistic.

tt0029583,rw9171470,mpjindustries-31649,Snow White and the Seven out of Ten,"You know, for a movie nearing a century old, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I ended up liking Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Despite its age and the occasional dated line, I think this movie still holds up to this day! Especially when you consider that was Disney's first-ever feature film as well as one of the first animated films ever made.

Now, I don't think this one is quite a masterpiece or anything. As Disney's first animated movie, you sort of tell the inexperience of both the writers and the animators as they attempt to find their footing in creating an animated feature film. But still, there's just something so charming and magical about this movie that makes it so inherently memorable and immersive, that I can't help but enjoy it in spite of its flaws.

I think what truly makes this film still hold up is how greatly it thrives off of its simplicity. Looking at this movie critically, it's a very straightforward and uncomplicated movie. But thanks to its charm and likability, its simplicity never feels bogged down by boredom. It's actually very refreshing to watch a movie like this that's so inherently simple and endearing that also isn't boring or aimless. And I think that's mostly due to this movie's great cast of characters.

Sure, while the characters are pretty simple, they're still very well-rounded and have their own unique memorability and charm to them. I can't really come to dislike any of them! Well... except for the Prince. He's pretty much an afterthought. Only appearing at the beginning of the film and the end, and his only relevance in the story is waking up Snow White from the Sleeping Death. So he's kind of lame, but everyone else is pretty good!

Snow White is a pretty decent protagonist. Yeah, she's pretty bland as far as general protagonists go-even in this era of Disney films-but I didn't hate her. In fact, I was kind of enthralled by her unwavering optimism and her motherly rapport with the Dwarfs. Speaking of which, the Dwarfs are great! I like how they have these intentional one-note personalities to help keep them distinct from one another. All the personalities match their designs well and they all have their own unique comedic charm to them.

But my favorite character in this movie is definitely The Evil Queen. She pretty easily stole the show whenever she was on screen. Her vanity and jealousy is so endearing here, with how far she's willing to go to inflate her own ego. I honestly wish she got more screen time in general because she isn't in that many scenes. But the scenes she is in are spectacular.

Obviously, the animation here is phenomenal. It's actually really impressive how vibrant and detailed this film can be, and it's the one thing in this movie that holds up extremely well nearly a century later and sometimes looks better than films released decades after. Even by Disney themselves! Well... Mostly. I'm not too fond of the rotoscoping used here for the more human-looking characters like Snow White and the Prince. It never dragged me completely out of the movie-viewing experience, but it did look a little off-putting at times. Oh well, at least they convey the realism that Walt and his team were attempting to capture.

But besides that, this movie is gorgeous. The beautiful backgrounds feel so warm and serene yet aren't afraid to change to be dark and sinister when the tone calls for it. Character animation outside of the rotoscoped characters is filled with expressive cartoony spirit. The environments are brimming with detail thanks to the multiplane camera. And like, this was all done in 1937! This must've been a monumental task for everyone involved, and I massively respect that.

Okay, that's enough positives. Now onto the flaws and shortcomings that I have issues with in this movie:

The romance between the Prince and Snow White is hilariously underdeveloped. Like, after the Prince meets Snow White once in the first couple of minutes of the movie, he just disappears until the very end when he awakens her with a kiss. It's hysterical. And even in the beginning, there's no real sense of romantic connection between either of them in their scant few interactions. He just... sings a song to her and she's instantly smitten.

Also, I think this movie is a little uneven in its pacing. Like, I found the first 15 minutes of the movie to be tightly packed and brisk. Same with the last 15 minutes, too. These moments in the story I felt were using its time most effectively. But then things slow way down in the middle chunk of the story when the Dwarfs return to their cottage. I liked the shenanigans that ensued fine enough in the second act, but I don't really think it moved the plot or characters forward too much. It honestly kind of felt like they were just padding out the film in order to give it a feature length.

But yeah. Overall, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a good movie! It's a really charming film with a likable and well-rounded cast of characters complimented by some gorgeous animation that still holds up over eighty years later.",7.0,2023-07-07,4,4,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt0029583,rw2292325,DKosty123,Historic Cornerstone Not Aging Well,"The real strength of this film is the animation. The reason it was so popular in 1937 when it was released was the bright colors & production quality that is obvious when you view it on a large screen. The music is top notch for it's era too. This was a full length color feature a full year plus before Robin Hood (1938). That and the popular Walt Disney who had already established himself in cartoons is why this became a land mark Disney film for many years.

Being the first however, the film now faces many of the draw backs that another Disney Feature, Song of The South, now faces. It is totally based upon a Fairy Tale & the Snow White children's tale has not aged well. The story in todays contemporary is now considered sexist. There are some negative messages in here because as a hallmark of Disney's, there is an adult level here which is beyond what the kids see. It has an unintentional negative message for children in the ending as well.

Still, this movie is important & not just as a historic first. This movies success is a primary reason that the 1939 Wizard of Oz was produced. Because this film sold so many tickets was a major reason for the way Oz was produced & why MGM spent so much money & time producing it 2 years later. MGM wanted to make the kind of money Disney made on this one.

Made 80 years ago, how does Disney's trailblazing animated feature hold up, he asked, having just watched it through in its entirety for the first time - I can't imagine how I haven't seen it in full at some point during the last half century or more. But now I have.

The story is familiar - this is a fairly faithful adaptation of the Grimm Brothers' original, albeit nicely tweaked to point up (for instance) the humorous role of the dwarfs and, frankly, to pad it - there are a number of sequences which are very entertaining but not very plot relevant. The drama works well, the character design is excellent, the animation is very good (and the effects animation is stunning), several of the songs are classics (and several aren't), and there are places where it is genuinely scary, especially for small children.

It's not perfect. Current audiences might find stylistic elements somewhat dated, and Adriana Caselotti as Snow White is rather irritatingly twittery.

Since this is a Disney movie, it goes without saying that the animation was absolutely gorgeous. It contains very fluid animation on top of very detailed backgrounds. It is also very atmospheric, with the mood changing from scary to happy and joyful a few times.
The songs were very wonderful and catchy. The actress who voiced Snow White had a very nice and unique voice. I also thought Hi Ho and the other song the dwarfs sing were very fun and ridiculously catchy. And of course it also had a very beautiful score.
Although there were some things keeping it from a perfect ten. The character of Snow White can at times be irritating in her flawlessness and purity. It felt like the prince was tacked on last minute as a deus ex machina. It seems with most Disney films at the time, the only enjoyable characters are the side characters and the villain. This movie is mostly loved because of the dwarfs. And who couldn't love those guys? They were hilarious. And the Queen was, of course, very menacing and scary.
It could also be argued that the movie had a lot of filler. Almost all Disney movies were full of filler in Walt's time. But most people don't really care, probably because of how entertaining the filler usually is.

I have never seen Snow White in its entirety, but I understood what happened in it. While watching it, I found myself getting a little bored especially when Snow White meets the dwarfs. It felt like one long sequence and I started to become very disinterested in the story. For me, the dwarfs were probably my favorite part of the whole story. What I like is that they all have different personalities, so it was entertaining to watch them all interact with one another. However, they started to become less entertaining during that long sequence between them and Snow White. If they were to add other elements to the story, it would be nice to sprinkle them throughout the story. Another character I enjoyed was the Evil Queen. I like Disney villians and they are all unique in their own way. She, along with the dwarfs, are the most entertaining in the film. Like I mentioned with the dwarfs, they started to get less entertaining. With the Queen, she was sprinkled throughout the story so there was a right balance with her character. In today's world, a film like this would not be tolerable given the message. The message of a woman relying on a man to save her life is a narrative that would be viewed as negative today.

tt6208148,rw10412865,mortradio,Another Hollow Remake That Cost a Quarter of a Billion Dollars,"This is just another Disney gamble that did not pay off. The difference, though, is that this abysmal film cost a quarter of a billion dollars.
That's right. $250,000,000.00.
And with that chunk of change, you get a low-rent cast that shouldn't be portraying the characters that they have been given, and CGI that reminds you that real dwarfs are necessary if one is to remake a live-action film about Snow White.
You can't really blame Disney on their decision to go through with the film, though. Even with the warning from the general public, they had already invested enough money into the project that they went ahead with it, hoping to get some return on their investment and a write off on their losses when tax time came around.
Of course, no one could predict the buffoonery of Rachel Zegler.
As we all know, Zegler was a PR nightmare. This needs to be address, even if it is a film review, since Zegler's personality carries onto the film itself.
Gal Gadot does not help matters either, since she plays the evil queen with the same vigor as a high school student. Frankly, it seems that she has never fully recover from the blunt reality check that her ""Imagine"" video gave.
The film itself is uninspiring. Sure, the visuals have been updated since the animated feature from 1937, but it does nothing for the story. In fact, the updated visuals take away from the innocence of the story, since every thing looks completely fake. Snow White does not look beautiful and innocent, but resembles a stock player at a parade event. The Evil Queen is not frightening, but instead almost looks comical. Cassandra Peterson would have done a better job as the Evil Queen.
Rachel Zegler gives an uninspiring performance as Snow White. She can sing, this cannot be argued, but her acting chops resemble a high school performance. At least Gal Gadot attempts to act, be it overacting. What is a bit humorous was with all the proclamations by Zegler that this ""Snow White"" was not a love story (by a ""stalker"") by a story of a woman empowered to be the leader that she is destined to be, the audience ultimately finds out that it is just a hollowed-out remake of the love story. In this film, Snow White is cared for by the Seven CGIs, and when she is put into her apple-coma, she is brought back to live by her love interest (who happens to be a thief, and not a prince....go figure). It is hypocrisy at its finest.
As far as the music is concerned, all songs sound nice, but they all are forgettable. You will not be humming ""Hi-Ho, Hi-Ho, its off to work we go"".
The CGI little ones are nightmare fuel, and the rest of the CGI effect (like the forest animals) look just as bad. There is nothing cute to look at. I can honestly see young children being frighten by these dwarfs. I can imagine CGI Dopey looking up at some kid and saying, ""Oh, yes. They float.... They float....and when you're down here with me.... YOU'LL FLOAT TOO!""
I saw this film mistake with my niece and nephew. I knew it was not going to be a pleasant two hours, and Disney did not disappoint. When my niece and nephew saw ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" (1971), for days they sang ""I've got a Golden Ticket...."". After seeing ""Snow White"", they went back to playing on their Xbox. Now that is as honest as a critique can be.
If you want your kids to see ""Snow White"", rent or buy the animated 1937 film. The innocence is still there, and perhaps your kids will learn that if you are good, then good things will happen to you. Perhaps a naive concept, but you have to give children all the hope you can.
""Snow White"" (2025) does not give anyone any hope. It just shows that ugly people can pretend to be nice people, but they are still ugly.",1.0,2025-03-28,166,29,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

From the first frame to the last, this movie is an insult to anyone who values cinema. The plot is a nonsensical jumble of ideas that not only fail to make sense but also seem completely random. It's as if the writers threw every trope into a blender, hoping that something would stick. Spoiler: Nothing does.
The acting was atrocious-if you can even call it that. The lead actor looked like they'd rather be anywhere else, delivering every line with the energy of a wet cardboard box. It was like watching someone who had no interest in the role try to read a script they barely understood. The supporting cast? Even worse. Their performances were so bad I was genuinely embarrassed for them. If this was a high school drama club production, I'd still be appalled.
The dialogue is so cringe-worthy that I almost wanted to walk out of the theater. The characters spoke like they were reading off a sheet of paper, with no chemistry or emotion between them. Any attempt at humor fell completely flat, and every ""dramatic"" moment was laughably contrived. It was as if the filmmakers thought slapping together some words would somehow create a compelling story.
Visually, it's a nightmare. The special effects are so poorly done that they look like they came from a low-budget student film. The cinematography was as uninspired as it gets-every shot felt lazy, like they were in a rush to get it over with. Not a single scene felt well thought out or purposeful. And the soundtrack? Forgettable, uninspired, and completely out of place.
The pacing was a torture. This film was way too long for the amount of nothing it offered. Scenes dragged on endlessly, and I found myself begging for it to end. By the time the credits finally rolled, I felt like I had just wasted hours of my life.
This movie is a crime against cinema. It's not just bad-it's a miserable, painful experience that will leave you regretting every second you spent watching it. Please, do yourself a favor: avoid this at all costs.

tt0029583,rw1613386,madeye666,A Masterpiece At Least,"Film-""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" Rating-G for General Audiences Creator-Walt Disney Release Year-1937

From the timeless melodies of ""I'm Wishing,"" and ""Heigh Ho,"" to the ballads of ""Someday My Prince Will Come,"" and ""One Song,"" the world's first full length animated feature is a brilliant sensation. It is a singularly amazing triumph, with memorable characters, catchy songs, and a fairy tale setting, this film outlined the recipe of old and upcoming films, like RAPUNZEL.

The most chilling part of this film-the dramatic villain-the Evil Queen, who turns herself into a hag to kill Snow White, so she can be ""Fairest in the land.""

And this film has it's place as the most fantastic DVD debut of all time for a Disney film. I do not have the discs, but borrowed them from a friend once, and I was in deep shock with the dazzling restoration in picture and sound.

The comic relief is a most spectacular hilarity in this film. With the Seven Dwarfs-Happy, Bashful, Doc, Sneezy, Grumpy, Sleepy and most memorable of all Dopey, this film is a pure treat with it's innocent charm in the department of comedy.

All in all, this film is a sheer joy-Spotless. It is a dazzling triumph and holds a place in everyone's heart. It is the most memorable of all Disney films.

tt0029583,rw1933241,cool_man-5,"""The One That Started It All"" Still Holds Up Well Today","North America's first full length animated feature was a hit when it was first released, and I can say with the most confidence that it is still a hit today.

The Story is about a young girl named Snow White and all the trials and tribulations she has to go through. Snow White is a ""slave"" to her stepmother, ""The Queen""( voiced beautifully by Lucille La Verne), but while doing all her work, she thinks of a prince and a brand new life for herself. Through many different events, (such as running through a dark and scary forest) Snow White reaches a cottage which is home to seven dwarfs. I wont say anymore, but the events that happen here are truly magical and add up well to the films exciting and maybe a little scary climax.

For a film made in 1937, this was quite ahead of its time. No one ever heard of someone producing a full length animated feature, and they thought the idea was completely absurd. Boy, did Disney prove them wrong! Modern film and animation owes a great deal to this film and all of the innovative things about it.

If you are looking to view this film and you don't currently own it, it might be hard to track down. The DVD version of the film is in ""The Vault""(Disney has a nasty way of doing this sort of thing) and the only way to get it would be through a site like eBay or Amazon, or seeing if any Used DVD stores or your local Video Rental Store has any to sell. An alternative would be to see it on VHS if you have VHS player and the Snow White VHS.

All in all, this has to be one of my favorite films of all time, and I still like to curl up under a blanket with some popcorn whilst watching this movie.

tt0029583,rw5758336,r96sk,The animation is simply incredible given it was released in 1937,"'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' never fails to impress when I rewatch it, the animation is simply incredible given it was released in 1937.
Admittedly, it doesn't all hold up to an outstanding degree nowadays. The dwarfs still look fantastic, but Snow White herself and the world itself don't quite look exquisite; Snow White is rather dull, especially her facial expressions. I still have massive respect for those who created this though, obviously.
The voice cast, as was usual in the early decades of Disney, are a little forgettable. Adriana Caselotti (White) and Lucille La Verne (Queen) do fine jobs, though it's Pinto Colvig who is most memorable as Grumpy.
The premise is a pretty light too, with the main saviour hardly featuring and the antagonist disappearing for relatively large portions. Nonetheless, it's a great film to watch with family as Disney's first production is good fun - the music plays a huge part in that regard.",7.0,2020-05-21,0,1,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt0029583,rw1315649,lee_eisenberg,"Does anyone remember when they performed this on ""The Brady Bunch""?  Or when the title characters watched it in ""Gremlins""?","Since everyone knows what happens here, I'll talk about a few aspects. In the Grimm brothers' original version, the dwarfs didn't have names; Disney added those and the respective personalities. Also, whereas here the dwarfs are slobs, in the original story they were very tidy - so why did they need Snow White to be a housekeeper? Today was the very first time in my life that I watched the whole movie (and I only watched it for a class). The first time when I saw any of it was in ""Gremlins"", when the mean green guys watched it. Also, I remember once on ""The Brady Bunch"" when the Bradys put on a production of it in their back yard to raise money for a retiring teacher.
One thing that comes to my mind is the fact that there are seven dwarfs. We all like to say that seven's the lucky number. Considering the names and personalities given the little guys here, one could infer that they represent the seven deadly sins: Grumpy is anger; Sleepy is sloth; Sneezy is greed (maybe he thinks that everyone owes him something because of his excessive sneezing); Bashful is lust; Doc is pride (if he's smarter than the others, he must be full of himself); Happy is gluttony (you may recall that he's pretty fat); and Dopey is envy (maybe he wishes that he was as smart as the others and talk like them). Expanding on this, maybe the dwarfs correlate to the characters on ""Gilligan's Island"": Gilligan is Dopey; the Skipper is Grumpy; Mr. Howell is Sleepy (he'd rather sleep than do work); Mrs. Howell is Sneezy (she seems like the type who's allergic to many things); Ginger is Bashful; the Professor is Doc; and Mary Ann is Happy. Speaking of dwarfs in general, I think that dwarfs are people whose limbs or other body parts are disproportionate to the rest, so the men here would be midgets.
Oh, wait a minute. I haven't even mentioned Snow White. Well, we all know that she's benevolent beyond credibility - and she's rather flat-chested for a grown woman. Watching the movie in this day and age, a person may feel tempted to throw out comments like on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"". When Snow White looked down the well, I said that it was like ""The Ring"", and when she entered the dwarfs' house, I suggested that she was guilty of breaking and entering.
So, that's my take on ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"". Until next time...Heigh ho/Heigh ho/It's back to school work I go...",5.0,2006-03-14,1,38,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

Sure it isn't the same as animation is now, but let's face it, most animation nowadays isn't very good. I can name a plethora of reasons why I love this movie. The animation is beautiful, with one or two stiff movements, but have a heart, it is the first Disney animation. The songs are mind-blowing, as well as the gorgeous incidental music(music similar to Great Expectations, 1946) that hardly anybody has mentioned. My favourite is ""Someday my Prince Will Come"", I cry every time I hear it. The characters are legendary, and the writing is top notch. Who can forget those adorable dwarfs, who added such a lot to this movie. Snow White is the weakest character but I like her innocence very much, and about her singing voice...it sounds weak, but in real life it must have been strong, and let me explain why. The colouratura soprano Amelita Galli-Curci was given the praise ""a beautiful and limpid voice"" yet I heard it on cassette and it sounds quite quiet. It has nothing to do with the size of the voice, but the quality of the recording. The best character was the wicked queen, who had the most classic animation scene I have ever seen... when she turns into a hag, which freaked me out big time when I was about 9, like Malificent from ""Sleeping Beauty."" To me the Queen is probably one of the scariest Disney villains ever. The scene at Snow White's coffin was heart-rending, and it was the music that made it so.

The only scenes i remember from my childhood, how","Snow White is the fairest one of all. The queen wants to be number one, so decides to come after her. Snow White, cut loose from the castle, stumbles upon a hut where seven dwarves are living - which is where the Queen comes for her, in disguise, with a poison apple...
This has classic written all over it. Disney's first major feature, the grand debut, cements the major features of those to come. It draws from very dark but fantastic material, Grimm's Fairy Tales, and alternates scenes of evocative darkness (the Queen's castle, the man sent to cut Snow White's heart out, and the forest that's alive, are some brilliant examples) with scenes of superlative cuteness and song and dance numbers.
Drawbacks:
There are some beautiful compositions, but the movement of the animation is not as fluid as it would become, even with Pinnochio, Disney's very next feature. Plus, the singing styles are very 1930's opera-style. I can see why i always used to just think of songs during musicals as things i had to wait through till the story got going again - its because almost every song in Snow White doesn't advance the story. Great musical numbers, like the ones in West Side Story, do. They don't feel like we're just waiting around. When most of the Snow White songs come on, the story gets put on hold.
Snow White is too naive, plain and perfect a character to hold our interest these days. Contemporary audiences just don't worship ""perfect"" people like this. Plus, the attempts at animation of real people is not good. Snow White and the Prince in particular just don't work - whereas the cartoony dwarves really come alive. Try watching her face when she talks.
Highlights:
All of the Queen's scenes are absolute gems, actually. And the dwarves are great. Seven great characters.
One of the best things Disney ever did was the Queen's angry walk down the staircase to the dungeon, and her subsequent making of a potion to transform herself into an old witch. The way the liquid she's mixing comes alive is fantastic, and the close-ups on the crow sitting on the skull are a nice touch.
The poison flooding towards the centre of the pot, engulfing the apple, and the jack o'lantern face on it afterwards.
Some of Disney's most classic songs come from Snow White: Whistle While You Work, Heigh Ho (its off to work we go), and one of the most beautiful Disney songs ever, Some Day My Prince Will Come.
There's also a very memorable piece of theme music that plays during the climactic storm scene.

First off, the writing is abysmal. The dialogue feels forced, the attempts at humor fall flat, and the changes to the story feel more like an agenda-pushing checklist than an organic adaptation. Snow White herself is completely devoid of personality, and rather than being a kind and courageous heroine, she comes across as smug and unlikable. The Evil Queen, who should be a scene-stealing villain, is reduced to a generic, one-dimensional antagonist.
The visuals don't help either. Despite a massive budget, the CGI looks cheap, the cinematography is dull, and the costumes are uninspired. Even the dwarves-if you can call them that-are completely forgettable. Whatever sense of wonder and whimsy Disney once had is long gone here.
But perhaps the worst part is how soulless the whole thing feels. Rather than honoring the timeless story that has captivated audiences for generations, this version seems embarrassed by its own source material. The filmmakers clearly wanted to ""fix"" Snow White, but in doing so, they drained it of everything that made it special.

tt0029583,rw2404321,hitchcockthelegend,As timeless as it is wonderful.,"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a Walt Disney production based on Snow White by The Brothers Grimm. The rest, as they say, is history. Famously said to be Disney's folly prior to release, Snow White has gone on to be one of the company's biggest earners; few, if anyone, can deny it's not the most deserving from Disney's back catalogue of being released every once in a while on different home formats. Very much a landmark movie for being the first full length animated feature, it also deserves its accolades for the high artistic quality that seeps from every frame. The advancements from Steamboat Willie ten years earlier are nothing short of incredible, the richness of the animation is a joy to behold, as the woodland creatures dart about with purpose, or the way the terror comes to life as Snow White runs thru the forest, the depth and clarity dazzles the eyes. Then of course there's the songs, most of which have formed part of pop culture ever since they were first heard. ""Whistle While You work,"" ""Heigh-Ho"" and ""Someday My Prince Will Come,"" each one a standard uplifter on a dreary day.
That the film is accessible to all ages obviously helped it gain universal appeal. Yes, very young kids are quite easily spooked by the darker moments that lay within, but around the corner is a treat, most notably in the form of 7 little dwarfs, each one with an identity and character that the young and old can fully embrace. One of the finest quotes I can remember about the dwarfs came from Charlie Chaplin, who straight out insisted that Dopey was ""one of the greatest comedians of all time"", and he's right of course. True enough it has some minor rough edges that time has inflicted upon it. Snow White is voiced by Adriana Caselotti, her voice is very 30s, very shrill and much too childlike for a character meant to be a young woman. Whilst she's not exactly painted in a good light, bit of an air-head is our Snow White, but to do down the film for its social portrayal of women in the late 30s would be churlish in the extreme!
Pixar, presently, keeps raising the bar, as computer-perfection-animation thrills the modern day crowd. But make no bones about it, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is still the benchmark animation movie. As technical advancements ensure we are wowed by this particular art form, Disneys folly watches over proceedings as the rightful lord of the manor.

Parts of it are troubling, such as Snow White's breaking and entering. Had that been my home she'd have been cuffed and booked. And her voice is annoying. (Talking of Snow White's voice, here's a trivia question: what is the single connection between Disney's ""Snow White"" and MGM's ""Wizard of Oz?"")
Surely the award for Disney's greatest achievement in animation belongs to ""Pinoccho."" And my favorite is ""Cinderella,"" though that may be because I played a minor role in a play based on the movie in 2nd grade. I was the guy with the monocle, though monocles were fewer on the ground then than they are in these post-steampunk days.
The introduction of the dwarfs is every bit as dazzling as it was when I saw it in a theatre at six. And while Snow White is occasionally cloying, the dwarfs (Tolkien would have something to say about that!) are all great. And though it's a far cry from today's music, I can't quibble with the songs. I like to sing along. Heigh-ho!
If you don't like it, that's your right. But don't poison others, who might enjoy it, against it. Don't destroy. Find something constructive to say. Be a builder.",10.0,2025-03-20,5,1,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

MIRROR MIRROR ON THE WALL Who is Fairest of them all? — The Mother of all Animation. The beautiful queen's beauty is exceeded only by her vanity So she needs to be reassured every day that She is the most beautiful female in the realm. Of this her magic all-seeing mirror reminds her daily until one day  Nope — not anymore Babe –your own step daughter, Snow White has now emerged from puberty and puts you to shame in terms of pure pulchritude. Oh NO!!- gotta get rid of that pert little bitch. Woodsman, take her out in the forest and do her in! But woodsman doesn't have the heart to bump lovely Innocent maiden off so he turns her loose and claims the wolves got her. But of course they didn't –So with all the friendly forest animals and birds — prancing fawns and flitting lovebirds — taking her under their wings (incredibly beautiful animation sequence) — they lead her to the cottage of the seven dwarfs who whistle while they work merrily in the nearby mines. (their cheerful songs kick in all of which became instant pop hits ~ Heigh ho, Heigh ho — it's off to work we go — etc.) — and the dwarfs each representing a certain state of mind or human foible — became stars on their own: HAPPY, Doc, Bashful, Sleepy, Sneezy, Grumpy and, last but not least, lovable Dopey. This was the first movie I ever saw at age six and I identified strongly with Dopey. Now it becomes a little horror film. The evil queen changes herself into a most scary witch and coming to the cottage in disguise as a friendly old hag offers blissfully naive Snow White the poison apple that puts her into a state of deathlike Suspended Animation — (pun intended) — The horrified dwarfs think she is dead and enshrine her in a class coffin and there she stays suspended until Prince Charming comes along and pulls her out if it with the fateful kiss of pure love –whereupon all Live happily ever after.
Anybody who can resist the visual beauty and magical charm of this mother of all animations, can only be the ultimate grump and should be put out of his misery with a poisoned apple — Disney's clean cut cartooning style is like Rembrandt to Peanuts in comparison to successor animation styles in terms of rendering skill and grace of image movement. The ultimate genius of the genre his Snow White is Evergreen and continues to out-dwarf the competition Seven and a half decades after it first appeared.

tt0029583,rw1742193,ackstasis,"Magic Mirror, on the wall, which animated feature film is the greatest one of all?","Contrary to common belief, Walt Disney's 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' is not the earliest feature-length animated film. This title goes to Quirino Cristiani's now-lost 1917 Argentinian film, ''El Apóstol / The Apostle.' Even as far as current availability in concerned, you can turn towards Lotte Reiniger's 'The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926)' for a brilliant animated film, featuring endearing silhouette animation and an exciting tale of heroes, villains and monsters. Released in 1937, 'Snow White' was Disney's first feature-length effort, as well as the first technicolour animated movie, and also briefly the most successful film of all time (until the release of 'Gone with the Wind' in 1939). After the excellent 'Fantasia (1940),' this was the second feature-length film I'd seen from Disney's early era, and I was instantly able to appreciate why it is so revered. One can only imagine how much effort must have gone into the 83 minutes of animation, and, despite this relatively brief running time, the film manages to flesh out so many wonderful characters and effectively evoke a range of emotions.
The story is roughly based upon the German fairytale by the Brothers Grimm. A beautiful and wicked Queen (voiced by Lucille La Verne) learns one day, through her Magic Mirror, that her stepdaughter  the beautiful Snow White (Adriana Caselotti)  has surpassed her in beauty. Enraged, the Queen orders the princess murdered, but the kind-hearted servant cannot bring himself to commit the act. Abandoned in the forest, Snow White is aided by the gentle animals of the forest, and she stumbles upon the modest dwelling of a group of seven dwarfs, respectively named Doc, Dopey, Sleepy, Grumpy, Sneezy, Happy and Bashful, each with a personality that mirrors their own titles. Though initially hesitant about having a woman in their home, the little men eventually come to appreciate her presence, and all is going well until the Queen learns of her servant's disloyalty, and so crafts a new and terrible revenge for the sweet and innocent Snow White.
Visually, 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' is nothing short of a masterpiece. Compared to the primitive cut-out silhouettes of 'The Adventures of Princess Achmed' just a decade earlier, the animation in this film is nothing short of staggering; every single frame is simply alive with vibrant colour and movement. In fact, the film proved such a monumental advance in the field of animation that it took until the arrival of Pixar Studios and CGI before anybody truly progressed beyond what had been achieved here. Colour is used magnificently to create intense moods, and the chasing of the Queen (transformed into a witch) through a raging thunderstorm is an absolute triumph of film-making, equal to anything produced before or since. Notably, a flawless 1937 Silly Symphonies short, 'The Old Mill,' served as an essential testing ground for many of the techniques used in 'Snow White,' including the animation of animals, rain, wind, lightning, ripples, splashes and reflections. Additionally, 'The Old Mill' also served as the trial-run for Disney's revolutionary multiplane camera, which was also used to remarkable effect here.",9.0,2007-10-07,2,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt6208148,rw10407282,hasin-53586,Disney Just Butchered Snow White,"I genuinely don't know where to begin with this film. Maybe by saying this: it's a tragedy. Not the good Shakespearean kind either-just a full-on disaster. As someone who grew up loving the original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, I walked into this remake hoping for even a spark of that old Disney magic. Instead, I walked out confused, disappointed, and a little bit angry. This movie is the exact opposite of what Snow White is supposed to be.
Let's talk about the casting, because I think it's the core of the problem. Snow White is supposed to be this radiant, kind, innocent girl who lights up the forest with her goodness and charm. The actress in this version? Not even close. I'm not trying to be mean, but she had none of the softness or warmth you expect from Snow White. Her performance felt stiff, robotic even, and honestly... she seemed more annoyed than enchanted by anything around her. Where's the wonder? Where's the sweetness? There was nothing graceful or inspiring about her, and that's heartbreaking because Snow White is supposed to inspire.
And don't even get me started on the seven dwarfs. Or should I say... the ""weird background group of people who kind of live in the woods and are just there."" They completely stripped the dwarfs of their individual personalities. In the original, each dwarf was unique-Grumpy was grumpy, Dopey was adorable, Doc was wise. That's what made them memorable. But in this remake, they're like an awkward side quest no one wants to click on. They felt like they were just thrown into the movie out of obligation.
Visually? Meh. The colors were muted, the forest didn't look magical-it looked like someone tried to film Lord of the Rings on a budget in their backyard. There was no enchantment. The original had charm dripping out of every frame-those little forest animals helping Snow White, the cozy little cottage, the sparkle of the wishing well. This version tried to be ""modern"" and ""gritty"" or whatever, but in the process, it lost its soul.
And then there's the writing. It felt like someone who didn't even like fairy tales wrote this script. Snow White didn't grow as a character-she just existed, said a few snarky lines, and that was it. There was no heart. No real lesson. And honestly, no real love either. The Prince (if you can even call him that) was barely in the film and felt like an afterthought. The romantic element, which in the original added such emotional depth, was completely gone. I get that times have changed and stories evolve, but changing everything doesn't make it better. Especially when you replace charm with attitude and wonder with bland empowerment slogans.
Disney had the perfect opportunity here. They could have remastered the 1937 version, added a few visual tweaks, maybe even extended a few scenes. That would've been worth watching. That would've made people cry with nostalgia. Instead, they delivered a half-baked modern mess that disrespects its own legacy.",1.0,2025-03-26,108,18,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

Some songs were added, which I don't think needed to. I don't think the film deserves as much hate it's getting yes it's not perfect or amazing, but I enjoyed a lot of it! My personal opinion for people is to not pay attention to the negative reviews and just going with an open mind that that's how I went in even though there were negative reviews that I read I was nervous going in, but I'm still happy I saw it!

Most of all, Snow White herself is sweet as pie and doesn't have an ounce of malice in her body; she shows everyone and everything kindness, something the people of the real world need.
The Disney of today may continue to push out uninspired slop while pretending to care about diversity by hiring minority actors (who then face the brunt of the remakes' hate instead of corporate) and giving two seconds of LGBTQ rep that can easily be edited out in China, but nothing can ever take away the love of the the film that started it all.",8.0,2025-03-20,6,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

tt0029583,rw0017066,Cylex,Learning to do it. Not the best but interesting.,"After being dismayed by Dinosaur & Tarzan (Luckily I rented them) I decided to re-watch Snow White. I love all the scenes with the forest creatures and I noticed a lovely simulation of a waterfall. There were other interesting sequences but I wouldn't call them spectacular. (Their technique rapidly improved - Pinocchio, Fantasia & Bambi provide evidence.) Snow White is a nice testing ground.
The characters didn't do much for me, especially the dwarfs. They have some amusing lines but the gags weren't that funny. The Queen didn't scare me. Snow White was gentle & nice but too youthful for the role. The Prince is just a plot device. The songs are memorable, although some are a little irritating. The film also seems overlong for such a simple story but that's just my reaction. But whatever faults you may find, this is a film for everyone. Don't forget. This is the film that made possible all the others and re-shaped the industry.

tt6208148,rw10407939,imdbfan-6802772223,A Disappointing Take on a Classic,"As someone who appreciates both classic Disney films and fresh reimaginings, I went into Snow White (2025) with an open mind. Unfortunately, what I got was a bland, uninspired adaptation that lacks the charm, heart, and magic of the original.
The biggest issue is the writing. The film strips away the fairy-tale wonder and replaces it with generic, uninspired storytelling. The dialogue feels forced, the emotional beats fall flat, and the pacing drags. Instead of enhancing the story, the changes to the original plot feel unnecessary, as if the filmmakers were trying too hard to make a statement rather than tell a good story.
The casting is another letdown. While there was potential, the performances feel wooden and lack chemistry. Snow White, a character who should embody kindness and wonder, comes across as oddly lifeless, and the supporting cast doesn't fare much better. The reimagined seven companions, in particular, feel out of place and lack the personality that made the dwarfs so memorable.
Visually, the movie has moments of beauty, but it's inconsistent. Some CGI-heavy sequences look rushed and artificial, breaking the immersion. The costume and set design, while ambitious, don't always fit the tone of the story, making it feel more like a generic fantasy film than a distinct Snow White adaptation.
Perhaps most disappointing is the lack of a strong musical presence. The original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is beloved in large part due to its iconic songs, but the new film's soundtrack is forgettable. Any attempts to modernize the music fall flat, making it feel soulless rather than enchanting.
Overall, Snow White (2025) is a missed opportunity. It fails to capture the magic of the classic while offering nothing compelling in return. Instead of a fresh and exciting reimagining, we're left with a hollow, uninspired film that will likely be forgotten soon after the credits roll. Disney has done far better with its live-action adaptations in the past-this one is a step in the wrong direction.",1.0,2025-03-27,189,37,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0
tt6208148,rw10400289,pimisi,Not Snow White,"This is not Snow White in any way-neither the story, the characters, nor the narrative. It should have just been named ""A Girl and an Evil Queen"".
I struggle to understand why studios drastically alter beloved stories instead of creating something new. A tale that has stood the test of time does so because of its themes, characters, and essence. Changing 80% of what made it a classic begs the question-why even call it the same story? At that point, it's less an adaptation and more a new narrative borrowing a familiar name.
It often seems like a marketing tactic, leveraging nostalgia and a built-in audience while delivering something barely recognizable. If they truly wanted to tell a fresh story, they could simply create one-perhaps ""inspired by"" the original. That way, they could modernize or innovate without alienating fans who love the classic for what it is.
Ironically, such drastic changes often lead to backlash rather than success. Fans feel betrayed, while new audiences may not connect with something that has lost its original magic. A well-crafted original story, even if influenced by an existing one, would likely be received far better than a hollow rewrite of something iconic.",1.0,2025-03-24,105,20,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0
tt6208148,rw10407524,imdbfan-2812577922,"A waste of time, talent, and resources.","Disney's live-action Snow White is not just bad-it's an insult to the original classic. From the moment the film starts, it becomes painfully clear that this remake has no heart, no soul, and no reason to exist beyond squeezing money out of nostalgia.
Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen is one of the biggest disappointments. Rather than exuding menace or charm, she delivers a bland, lifeless performance that feels more like a last-minute casting decision than a carefully chosen role. Her lack of depth makes the Queen more laughable than intimidating, turning an iconic villain into a forgettable mess.
The worst part? The film's attempt to ""modernize"" the story comes off as painfully forced and preachy. Instead of adding depth, it strips away the whimsy and wonder that made Snow White a beloved fairytale in the first place. The story drags through dull, uninspired dialogue, and any attempt at emotional weight feels hollow.
Visually, the film is another disaster. The excessive CGI looks cheap and artificial, making everything feel more like a second-rate video game than a big-budget Disney production. Instead of immersing the audience in a magical world, it actively pulls them out of the experience with lifeless backdrops and characters that feel oddly disconnected from their surroundings.

tt0029583,rw3006658,cherold,Impressively Animated,"Snow White was Disney's first feature-length cartoon, and it's clear he wanted something that would wow audiences. The animation is ambitious and wonderfully detailed. Of particular note is the scene of Snow White running through the forest and the scenes involving the forest animals. Those forest animals are the single most impressive thing in the movie, flowing and swirling like leaves in the air, almost constantly in motion yet never unpleasantly chaotic.
At the same time, these scenes have been so well parodied in other movies that at times they seem a bit absurd. Even before the parodies, there is something over the top about the dainty, domestic princess with a way with animals.
For me, the movie lost a little momentum with the entry of the dwarfs, whose broad humor interested me less than the more serious earlier animation. This is not to say that the dwarfs weren't funny, in that mild, Disney way (both now and as a child I preferred the sharp, sarcastic style of Warner Brothers cartoons to the genial Disney style), but the focus on comedy meant less of a focus on pure artistry.
The movie is also very much of its time. Snow White is the small-town girl ideal, a sweet and trusting princess who wanders into an empty house and immediately starts cleaning it. She has the girlish voice of Betty Boop without the attitude, and I found her a bit bland (although less so than Sleeping Beauty, many years later.

It was directed by, Ben Sharpsteen, William Cottrell, Perce Pearce, Wilfred Jackson, David Hand, and Larry Morey. The film was made by Disney. Walt Disney's wife said the the movie who flop but the movie got what is now considered as 418 Million USD. This was also the first movie to ever release it's soundtrack.

I thought this movie is bad because the prince in the movie is 31 while Snow white is 14 and I found this to be very creepy. Also the prince just shows up exactly at the right time and even though he thinks snow white is dead he still kisses her. This movie also wasn't funny but I did enjoy some sequences with the Dwarfs.",3.0,2022-09-17,0,25,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt0029583,rw3388885,grantss,Wonderful animation classic,"Wonderful animation classic.
A Disney movie, based on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale. A young princess, Snow White, is despised by her jealous Queen. The Queen arranges for a huntsman to kill Snow White in the forest, but he is unable to do it. Snow White escapes into the forest, stumbling across a house occupied by what appears to be seven children...
Revolutionary for its time, and still brilliant today, Snow White is an absolute classic, not just among animated movies or Disney movies, but among movies full stop. Sweet story, excellent animation that still looks fantastic today and some great songs, many of which are instantly recognisable even if you haven't seen the movie before.
Ideal for all ages too - not just a children's movie.",9.0,2016-01-05,4,1,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt6208148,rw10396430,wjmcginn-59112,Look past the commotion and you'll have a fun time.,"It's honestly quite eye-rolling how people have ganged up on this movie. It's clear they have nothing better to do than to try to bring people down. I'd hate to live my life like that. Especially considering this movie turns out to be one of the most innocent features to come out in a while.
I went into Snow White without any devoted dedication to the original. For the first ever full-length animated feature, it has some good expressions, refreshingly organic animation, good colours and decent slapstick. It's also kind of slow-paced in my opinion, and I find it more enchanting as a piece of history than something I'll want to revisit. This movie on the other hand...
I knew they were trying a few new things with this one, and I was more interested in what those would be than honouring the original. And I have to say this new but still familiar take on the classic story was a feast on the eyes and especially the ears.
This is more of a Frozen-style musical, which is a hit-or-miss genre for me, but turns out, the songs, especially the new songs, are delightful. There are a few times where I felt they could've shaved off one or two, or not paused before the end. But every song was toe-tapping, and got better the more they went along. My favourites had to be Waiting on a Wish, Good Things Grow, and Hand Meets A Hand. I'm generally not a fan of musicals with too much music, because sometimes I feel there are moments that are better spoken than sung. This is no exception. But every moment where I felt that, I have to admit, the song was still decent. They don't get rid of the songs from the original, but the completely new songs were my favourites.
The dwarfs were a bit off-putting at first, but that's primarily because I'm so used to seeing them in cartoon form after all these years, whether from the original movie or in promos. But the truth is, if they were more similar to their original designs, they probably would've seemed plastic. And as the movie went on, I got used to them. Dopey took a fair minute, but I grew to like each of their designs.
And Rachel Zegler is incredible. I became a fan of hers after The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, and I knew from that film she was going to be an amazing Snow White and she did not disappoint. Her singing, her soul, her completely natural and sincere performance...she's always been an amazing actress, and since this is her most popular project yet, I hope people really see it for what it is and give her the praise she deserves.
Snow White's two main messages are simple; united we stand, divided we fall. And rulers who hoard wealth and create division are evil. Oh, and that a bit of kindness goes a long way. Sometimes it's very on-the-nose. And it could've gone further in those messages. But in the end...those things are there, and they are the truth. What this movie is is a simple display of these messages, but in a world where we're encouraged to hate one another so much, it's nice to see a movie proud to promote inclusivity and togetherness, and how those values make you a true leader for the people. Kids will enjoy the messages, but adults may be reminded of how these things they were probably taught when they were kids...maybe they need a reminder of them? Like To Kill A Mockingbird, the movie reminds us that sometimes adults forget themselves and lose their innocence. And maybe it wouldn't be a bad thing to try and reclaim it.
This live-action remake honours the original that started animation as we know it, and extends the world with a more involving story, some new terrific songs, and a superb lead actress carrying it all. It's not perfect but it's honourable. Like the 2007 Hairspray, I finished the movie with my feet tapping. I'm looking forward to watching it again.

tt0029583,rw2353058,blanbrn,"One of my favorites, maybe Disney's all time best. It proves that beauty defeats the wicked. Heigh-Ho!","From having watched this classic as a kid and to just recently viewing it, I must say that this picture is a timeless classic. ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is an excellent moral tale of good against evil, it's a historical film as it was Disney's first full feature animated tale and it's paced along perfect with songs and uplifting scores. This film could be classified as a musical too.
Originating from a Grimms tale this is a magical moral story that will entertain one of any age as it's message is timeless. The story centers around a beautiful and kindhearted princess named Snow White and shamefully she is forced to be a working slave that scrubs floors and all this comes from her wicked and jealous stepmother the Queen. Still that doesn't hide the charm that this princess has as she charms every creature in the kingdom. Interesting and somewhat of a fortune telling experiment is the Magic mirror telling the Queen that Snow White is the fairest one of all. This enrages the Queen as she has deadly plans for Snow White so it's time for this little princess to get away.
Snow White goes on an uncertain journey adventure fleeing into the forest where she meets cute animals and later she befriends the odd and strange but lovable seven dwarfs named Doc, Sneezy, Grumpy, Happy, Bashful, Sleepy and Dopey. Lessons are learned and love is developed as these little guys learn to be neat and clean and whistle and ""Heigh-Ho"" while they work at an old diamond mine! Only a favor is returned to Snow White as the Queen's wicked transformation is pushed over a cliff with help from her seven friends. And a nice beautiful return to life from the deadly apple is provided in the form of the prince's kiss. And they live happily ever after in this wonderful fairy tale.
Overall one of Disney's best a good moral tale of good against evil proving that friendship helps and that beauty will win over the wicked. And the animation work was among Disney's earliest this is a highly memorable classic to be enjoyed with a loved one. So ""Heigh-Ho"".",10.0,2010-12-14,4,1,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

Forced to flee into the forest from a death decree by her wicked step-mother, the queen, Snow White falls into the loving hands of the 7 dwarfs who with their completely different personalities provide the need affection that she craves. They warn her to keep the door locked for they know that the Queen will stop at nothing to kill Snow White, so that she can be the fairest of them all.
It is to be noted that Lucille LaVerne played both the wicked Queen and the old woman disguised to bring death to Snow White. Miss LaVerne was the wicked woman with the guillotine in 1935's memorable ""A Tale of Two Cities,"" as well as the loving mother in 1931's ""An American Tragedy,"" which was made over as ""A Place in the Sun,"" in 1951.

tt6208148,rw10391220,ericknupp,Fair but stale!,"Snow White is not a bad movie. It is hardly a masterpiece either. The movie, although beautifully made, lacks the gentle beauty of the classic 1937 animation. The good intentions in making this movie and the goal to modernize it for younger audiences can be well seen, but was it really necessary?
From a song in which Snow White actually gives consent to the ""prince"" character prior to her eating the poison apple, to poor character development, inclusion of pointless characters and toning down of the Evil Queen's scary and devilish looming presence, the movie seems to be a patchwork quilt of some politically correct behavior, a not very deep story (although it tries to be), characters we know and love and some new ones we're introduced to and don't really get to know (and never do).
Rachel Zeggler both acts and sings beautifully and her theme song is a show stopper. Her vocals I dare say are clearer than Halle's Part of Your World. Now, Gal Gadot (oh boy) plays a flowy and way too over the top Evil Queen, that unfortunately is but a far dying echo of the Evil Queen in the animation.
Production problems and reshoots can be clearly seen when Snow White's hair distractingly changes both length and style, sometimes in the very same music sequence.
Speaking of music sequence, the Evil Queen absolutely did not need songs of her own, what breaks her character and makes us lose credibility in her evilness. She just feels...goofy.
I personally also felt a slight little political theme here and there, but that might just be me.
That being said, again the movie is not bad. It's CUTE and endearing but a little stale, like a cookie that's not very well baked, but it still ok. The visuals and CGI are stunning and, yes, I can see some uncanny valley happening with the dwarfes but nothing distracting or creepy at all. They look amazing nonetheless and the details are jaw dropping (Dopey was actually my favorite character in the movie).
However, it trying too hard to be politically correct (""and evidently so"") and to please everyone are what make the experience only a little less enjoyable.",6.0,2025-03-21,155,1504,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

tt0029583,rw2379330,nEoFILM,Darker than you might expect...,"The first of Walt Disney's historic features was a pleasure to watch. Beautifully animated with deceptively gentle strokes, we are delicately guided through the Brothers Grimm's fairy tale. But this is still a fairy tale and a 1930′s film, made at a time where stories were not so toned down for our children, and a healthy dose of fear and horror was not shied away from.

Snow White is definitely a ditsy princess, so innocent that her counter has to be the personification of pure evil and she certainly is. The Queen, represents some of our darkest emotions, and there is little effort to tone this down, which I liked, a lot. She is evil, driven by her vain jealously to firstly attempt to have Snow White murdered, and then failing that, to poison her into a narcoleptic state and have her buried alive! Is this what you now think of a s Disney film, with a U rating? No, but thanks to this and the following films successes, this is a prized classic and untouchable. I think that this is a true family movie, with as much darkness as there is light, with some great musical numbers, indelible characters and an animation style which is truly timeless.

I mean this is a musical which was made in Technicolor less than ten years after the innovation of sound was introduced to black and white films. This is a film which children feel a part of and don't even compare to black and white's of the same era, which of course, they hate and don't feel are real.

This thing might be Disney's biggest blunder in history, and I don't say that lightly. ""The Black Cauldron"" developed a passionate cult following. ""Home On the Range"" had some good soundtracks and Steve Buscemi. Disney's new remake of their 1930s animated classic just has absolutely no redeeming quality whatsoever, from this new pauper boy character shoehorned in awkwardly to attempt to appease angry fans of the original, to the offensively hideous CGI and derivative musical numbers where Rachel Zegler belches out her hopes and woes and dreams while staring up awkwardly into random space.
The cinematography is bad and aesthetic designs rely far too much on muted colours and digital padding to try and flesh out this rather dreary scenery into something more vibrant and alive. The costumes look absolutely foolish with the exception of Gal Gadot's. I know people keep on holding out hope for Disney, but we're all adults here, and we grew up. We have kids now who want to see new movies. Disney failed to grow up with us, and a new generation of children wants their 90s Disney Renaissance, but let's be honest here - they're not magical. Snow White is the result of nostalgia commodified, the byproduct of a multinational corporation that has given up on caring or never really cared at all. There's not even anything of value added to the story to make it fresh and new, they just took the original animated version's story and inbred it with a tired old warrior princess uprising resistance thing that ""Maleficent"" and ""Alice in Wonderland"" have already used. You couldn't even pay me to watch this again, but on the bright side it might finally wake Disney up to the fact that they can't just coast by on nostalgic properties and overpriced theme parks anymore.",1.0,2025-03-21,163,32,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

In addition, as the magic mirror said, nothing could hide her beauty. Also, she could truly sing. Well, despite the fact that everyone in this film could sing, Snow White was the best. This would probably be because she did most of the singing. To me, the scenery was beautiful, the cast was well chosen, and the writing was strong. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well.

It is unfortunately kept from perfection by glaring issues. The story is a classic we have all likely heard before, Snow White is a young women who gets chased from her home and lives in the forest with dwarves.
The animation is absolutely stellar for the time and holds up remarkably well today. The movie is full of happy, charming moments and the witch is the highlight of the movie.
It has some minor pacing issues The important plot points are rushed and the smaller things get a lot of screen time, now that isn't necessarily a bad thing but watching the dwarves shenanigans for over 15 minutes is probably not up everyone's alley and frankly feels like filler. The music ranges from catchy to an absolute miss, which is likely due to the audio quality of the time. The plot is very similar to sleeping beauty and other later Disney movies and while Snow White gets credit for being the first, later movies did it better.
Overall this is a fun, well animated movie especially for its time! Snow White is definitely overrated but I would still recommend everyone see it at least once. Kids are likely going to get more enjoyment out of this one than adults.",5.0,2024-04-11,0,9,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt0029583,rw3083012,thomas2193,The one that started it all,"The One that started it all. Walt Disney and his company took one major risk with the release of the first ever theatrical animation feature. It was all or nothing. If Snow White would've been a disappointment, perhaps Disney wouldn't even exist today. But instead, the risk paid off and today, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs still stands as one of the best animation films. The film did well in the box office back in 1937 and it allowed Disney to start producing a lot of timeless classics in the years that followed.

Snow White is a princess, dressed in rags and reduced to work for the evil queen, who fears the beautiful princess. The queen sends a hunter to murder Snow White and to deliver her heart in a box. The hunter can't commit the murder and tells Snow White to hide herself from the evil queen. Snow White finds a little cottage in the woods were seven dwarfs live, who work in the mines during the day, digging for diamonds, although they don't know why, as they mention in the catchy song 'Heigh Ho'. She cooks for the dwarfs and they start to care for Snow White. Even Grumpy, although he wants you to believe he doesn't. While they are off to the mine, the evil queen pays a visit to the cottage, disguised as an old, ugly beggar. Snow White is unaware of the fact that the beggar is actually the queen, so she invites her into the cottage, takes a bite out of a poisoned apple and dies. The forest animals warn the dwarfs, who chase the queen before she drops off a rock and dies. They bury Snow White in a glass coffin, because they can't bring themselves to bury her in the earth. She gets kissed by a prince, comes back to life and they live happily ever after.

The first Disney Classic holds a special place in the hearts of many Disney fans and it's easy to see why that is. Snow White is very enjoyable from the start to the finish. It's not a perfect film, like Beauty and the Beast, but still, it was really groundbreaking for 1937. Just 9 years prior, Disney released Steamboat Willie and it's just unreal considering what Disney managed to accomplish in those 9 years. The animation looks tremendous. There's definitely an eye for detail, as was common with most of the early classics. I really appreciate that style of animation. Details can add a lot. In Snow White, they don't distract from the narrative, which is important. Now what really makes this film such a success are the dwarfs. They are a great collection of compelling characters. I especially like Grumpy, he brings a lot of fun to the table. The other dwarfs are memorable as well. Snow White may not be very interesting and her singing voice is the only thing about this film that feels outdated after 77 years. But her character works good enough to make for a great film. The ending may sound cliché, but it was the first time they did it, so I don't mind it very much here.

If Mickey Mouse was the rock on which the House of Disney was built, then SNOW WHITE and the SEVEN DWARFS was the cement that helped form the Disney conglomerate as we know it today.
Rudimentary by today's standards, SNOW WHITE nevertheless remains a masterpiece of animation because it possesses two qualities totally lacking in most of today's computerized works : Heart and Soul. Despite the advancement in technology, regardless of the magic of pixels and virtual imagery, most present-day animated features lack basic storytelling skills, relying rather on the easy clever remark and an annoying tendency to preach than tell a good tale. And nothing can compare to the inspired and solid craftsmanship of Disney's original ""old man ""team of animators who bravely learned their trade while creating this nascent work of art. SNOW WHITE is the cornerstone of all of Walt Disney's greatest animated films : an involving story, characters the audience can care for and identify with, superbly drawn animation put into brilliant motion and heightened by the innovative use of the then revolutionary multi-plane camera ( a device that dramatically changed the look of cartoons, giving scenes a third dimensional look). Added to all these innovations were the remarkable songwriting contributions of Frank Churchill and Leigh Harline, responsible for the superb musical score.
""Someday My Prince Will Come"", Heigh Ho"" and ""Whistle While You Work' are just three examples of an entire soundtrack that is a model of perfection and to this day one of the great movie song scores of all time. One could go on and remark on the incredible detail afforded the dwarfs' home, the wood sculpturing that adorns everything from the little mens' beds to stair-posts and doorknobs.

The year was 1915, and the black-and-white silent movie made a profound impression on him. So Disney took a correspondence course in cartooning. A few years later he moved to Los Angeles: the city at the center of the animation industry. It was here that the first official Walt Disney Studio was established in the early 1930s.
The story in ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" originated in Europe during the Middle Ages. It tells the tale of a wicked Queen who tries to kill her beautiful stepdaughter. Fortunately, the girl manages to escape into the forest, where she seeks refuge with seven dwarfs in a small cabin. But the evil Queen doesn't give up that easily...
In the mid '30s Walt Disney ran the most successful animation studio in Hollywood. With ""Steamboat Willie"" he had made the world's first talking cartoon, and with ""Flowers and Trees"" the first one in color. Now Disney aspired to try something new. He wanted to make a full-length animated movie. And he had an old favorite in mind. Walt Disney Studios was to film ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"".
It turned out to be a shockingly complicated venture. The costs soon broke all calculations, and Disney had to mortgage his beloved home to be able to pay the large staff of cartoonists. When, after three years of hard work, they were finally finished, the project was widely known as ""Disney's Folly"" in Hollywood. No one thought the film would ever be able to recoup the money Walt Disney had put into it.
Luckily, they were all wrong. The movie became a global sensation. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until ""Gone with the Wind"" displaced it in 1939. ""Snow White"" was also the first movie to release a soundtrack album. At the Academy Awards that year Disney was given one normal-sized, and seven miniature Oscar statuettes.",8.0,2022-11-13,2,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

I don't think you can, which is partly why I love this movie. It's completely wonderful and charming, but the fact that it brings up such nostalgic feelings, and I can recite every line, make it nearly perfect.

The evil queen is so, well, evil! She is so evil, she is willing to make herself the ugliest old hag around in order to kill poor, sweet Snow White!

Snow White, on the other hand, is the sweetest and most gentle young girl (she is only 14, you know). She wouldn't hurt a fly!

And, of course, the dwarfs are the humor in the story. Grumpy is my favorite!

But it still holds up even today and it was a nice start for Disney. I mean it has catchy songs, lovable characters (especially Dopey), funny humour and lovely animation and charming music.

The characters of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs are all charming, lovable and memorable. They all stand out in there own way, but my favourite is Dopey even though he doesn't say anything but as Walt Disney himself put it ""He's nice but sort of silly"". But that's what I like about him; he's clumsy and funny.

This film is a classic in it's own way and it was one of the highest grossing films ever around the time it was first released. And it's enjoyable for both kids and adults. And it's also one of the few films that made me cry. I mean, yes, the film made me smile a lot because it's such a charming feature but the scene where Snow White is in sleeping death and the seven dwarfs gathered around her and crying is such a sad scene that it made me cry as well.

tt0029583,rw9479033,springfieldrental,The First Cel-drawn Animated Feature Film Cartoon; the One That Established the Disney Empire,"Walt Disney took an educated gamble that proved to be one of the biggest success stories in cinematic history. If he had failed, there would not be any Disney Studios, no Disneyland, and possibly no animated feature films. His release of December 1937's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" was met with a great deal of skepticism just before its premier. In development for three years, the lead-up to the world's first cel-animated feature cartoon was derided by the press as ""Disney's Folly."" Even Lillian, Disney's wife, coldly told him ""No one's ever gonna pay a dime to see a dwarf picture.""
The stress Walt Disney went through during those three years was immense. His brother Roy and Lillian had many extensive conversations with him to dissuade the studio owner from his ambitious project as the bills piled up. Walt had to mortgage his house to pay his large staff of animators. From an early estimate of $250,000, the final costs skyrocketed to an astronomical $1,500,000 to complete ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" one of the largest expenditures in Hollywood's history at the time. Needing an extra $250,000 to push the movie over the finish line, Walt met with Bank of America executive Joseph Rosenberg to secure a loan. When the banker sat through a rough draft of the movie, he told the sweating Disney, ""Walt, that thing is going to make a hatful of money,"" as he signed off on the loan.
Rosenberg's premonition proved correct. Hollywood's glitz and glitter showed up at the Los Angeles premier on December 21, 1937, to see history being made. Greeted by a standing ovation at its conclusion, Walt was reassured he had a hit on his hands. A month later ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" opened in New York's Radio City Music Hall to sell-out crowds. 'Disney's Folly' leapfrogged the previous record at the box office for a film with sound, 1928's Al Jolson's ""The Singing Fool"", and remained the reigning champion until 1939's ""Gone With The Wind."" Over the years, with international releases and multiple domestic re-releases, the landmark cartoon has raked in well over $400 million, ranking it in the top ten of all-time American film moneymakers adjusted for inflation. It is the highest grossing animated feature film ever produced.
When ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" was first released, Variety's review was typical of the accolades of Disney's efforts. ""So perfect is the illusion, so tender the romance and fantasy, so emotional are certain portions when the acting of the characters strikes a depth comparable to the sincerity of human players, that the film approaches real greatness."" Today ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" still amazes the critics. Wrote modern film reviewer Adam Kuhn, ""What a great experience this film was. To think it was made in 1937 is astounding to me. Seeing the old animation made the film more romantic to me.""
Walt was always intrigued by the Brothers Grimm German fairy tale as early as 1916 when he was 15 watching a special presentation of the silent film ""Snow White,"" with four projectors playing the movie simultaneously on four separate screens. The original Grimm tale didn't attach any names to the dwarfs. Fifty names were submitted by Walt and his team of writers. Once settled, each character was different from one another, each possessing distinguishing traits.
The voice of Snow White was spoken by 18-year-old Adriana Caselotti, who's father taught music in New York City. Walt asked him if any of his students had a natural voice. Guido Caselotti mention his daughter, whom Disney loved after hearing her audition. He wanted to keep Adriana name a secret and had her sign a restrictive contract prohibiting her from any further film work. Besides a brief part in 1939's ""The Wizard of Oz,"" Adriana never used her voice for any film role again. Veteran stage actress Lucille La Verne was the voice of the Wicked Queen. She was inside a recording booth working on another movie when she heard Disney was scouting for the voice of the Old Witch and the queen. She excused herself and returned shortly after. Disney's assistants sat stunned as she read the witch's lines in a raspy voice, quite different then her familiar one. Asked how she changed her voice so drastically, she replied, ""O, I just took my teeth out.""
After ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'"" run at Radio City Music Hall, the New York City theater's owners noticed a peculiar stench in the theater. During the sequence where Snow White is running through the forest to get away from her hunter assassin, children in the audience, frightened beyond belief, wet their pants. All the velvet seat upholstery had to be taken out and replaced.
""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" had a number of admirers, including Charlie Chaplin and Sergei Eisenstein, with the Russian director labeling it the greatest film ever produced. Adolf Hitler included it in his top three favorite films; the other two were 1933's ""King Kong"" and 1941's ""Sun Valley Serenade."" The Academy Awards nominated Disney's motion picture for Best Musical Score, and is one of the first movie soundtracks to be released on a record album. Walt received a honorary award from the Academy, presented during its annual ceremony by 10-year-old Shirley Temple. The trophy consists of a full-sizes and seven miniature Oscars with a plaque stating Walt's ""significant screen innovation which has charmed millions and pioneered a great new entertainment field.""
The American Film Institute ranks ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" as the Number One Animated Film, the 34th Best Movie of All-Time, the Wicked Queen as the Tenth Most Villainous Character, and 'Someday My Prince Will Come,"" as the 19th Best Song in Movies. Harper's Bazaar lists Disney's feature as the best animated film. MGM, seeing the film's success, decided to proceed with its own fantasy project by initiating the production of 1939's ""The Wizard of Oz."" The immense profits Walt realized from Snow White allowed him to build an enormous $4.5 million studio in Burbank, California, which still stands today. It also prompted Disney to begin producing further feature length cartoons such as ""Pinocchio,"" ""Fantasia,"" and ""Bambi"" among others. The pioneering film is included in the '1,001 Movies You Must See Before You Die' reference book.",10.0,2023-12-07,3,1,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt6208148,rw10395339,utcrystal,Sadly ruined my childhood memory,"If you want to preserve the cherished memories of your childhood, I strongly advise against watching this movie. Some stories are best left untouched, remaining as beautiful, nostalgic moments in our minds. However, this film takes those beloved memories and distorts them into something unrecognizable. If you grew up loving the original tale, this adaptation may leave you feeling disappointed, disheartened, or even frustrated.
Furthermore, if you have children and are considering taking them to see this movie, you may want to think twice. Children are especially sensitive to visuals, and this film, rather than offering a magical, heartwarming experience, may instead introduce them to unnecessary fear. If your goal is to protect them from nightmares, then it would be wise to choose another film, one that truly embodies the spirit of wonder and adventure that fairy tales are meant to inspire. Rather than enchanting young viewers, this movie might unsettle them, leaving them with eerie images rather than joyful dreams.
One of the few redeeming qualities of the film might be the seven CGI dwarfs. In a movie that struggles in many other aspects, the visual effects team seems to have done a commendable job in bringing these characters to life. The animation and rendering of the dwarfs are well-executed, offering some of the only moments of genuine charm throughout the film. While CGI in modern films can often feel artificial or lifeless, the dwarfs in this adaptation manage to have some personality and visual appeal, providing at least a small highlight in an otherwise lackluster experience.
However, impressive CGI alone is not enough to save a film that falters in storytelling, character development, or emotional depth. While the technology used to create the dwarfs might be impressive, it does little to mask the shortcomings of the film as a whole. A movie should offer more than just visual spectacle-it should captivate, inspire, and transport its audience into a world worth believing in. Unfortunately, this adaptation fails to achieve that, leaving viewers with little more than a sense of disappointment.
In the end, if you value the magic and purity of the story you once knew, this film might not be the right choice for you. There are plenty of other adaptations and interpretations of classic fairy tales that do justice to their original magic and wonder. Instead of risking the disappointment that this movie might bring, consider revisiting the versions of the story that made you fall in love with it in the first place. Whether it's an animated classic, a beautifully written book, or even a stage adaptation, there are countless ways to experience the magic of this story without subjecting yourself to an underwhelming film.
For those who are still curious about the movie, perhaps the best approach is to manage expectations. If you go in expecting a faithful, heartfelt adaptation, you might leave feeling let down. But if you watch it with the understanding that it may take creative liberties, alter the tone, and possibly even stray far from the heart of the original, then you might be able to find small moments of enjoyment-especially in the CGI work. Just don't expect it to leave you with the same warmth and wonder that the original story once did.
Ultimately, the choice is yours, but be prepared. Whether it's protecting your childhood memories or shielding young viewers from unsettling imagery, there are valid reasons to be cautious about this film. If nothing else, at least we can acknowledge that the visual effects team put in the effort to make the seven dwarfs look good. Unfortunately, that alone may not be enough to make this movie worth watching.",1.0,2025-03-22,156,31,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

The story follows a princess whose mother dies and whose father remarries. When he leaves for war, her stepmother reveals her true, diabolical nature. She orders Snow White to be killed in the woods, but when Snow White mysteriously disappears, the queen assumes she's dead-until she discovers otherwise and decides to handle things herself.
Directed by Marc Webb (500 Days of Summer), the film stars Rachel Zegler (West Side Story), Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman), Andrew Burnap (Spare Room), and Tituss Burgess (Dolemite Is My Name).
This was an uneven film-not as bad as some are saying, but far from great. There were aspects I really enjoyed: Gal Gadot delivered a fantastic performance, the costumes were impressive, and the magical elements of the woods and the dwarfs' house were well done. I particularly liked the sequence of Snow White running through the forest.
Unfortunately, the film relies too heavily on CGI, which makes it feel hollow. The dwarfs, aside from Grumpy (who pretty much carried the film), lacked personality. The love interest was a complete misfire-his look and demeanor felt more like a Gap commercial than the rugged, Robin Hood-type character the story needed. The songs were more miss than hit, and while the ending was solid, the film as a whole just left me wanting more.
In conclusion, Snow White isn't a total waste of time, but it's far from the classic it could have been. I'd give it a 6/10.",6.0,2025-03-22,54,476,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

Despite the potential for a modern, enchanting live-action remake, this film feels overly artificial and devoid of genuine magic.
The sets and visuals seem contrived, leaving the audience longing for the lush, immersive environments of the animated original. The portrayal of the dwarfs, which should have been charming and central to the story's heart, comes across as uninspired and awkwardly handled.
Gal Gadot's performance as the Evil Queen is a major disappointment. While her striking appearance is undeniable, her portrayal lacks the depth and menace needed to embody such an iconic antagonist. Moreover, Snow White's costume design and hairstyle feel strangely out of place, failing to evoke the timeless elegance of the character.
The musical elements, a key part of Disney's charm, lack the memorable tunes and emotional resonance audiences hope for. The overall film suffers from a lack of coherence, making the experience more cringe-worthy than captivating.

The title is a reference to purity and influence. It is something Walt Disney joined in favor of its seemingly mystical translation. She labors for her evil Queen mother who grows frustrated when her magic mirror informs her that Snow White is the fairest of them all. Perhaps she needs to learn how to take criticism. She orders that Snow White be killed but she flees into the forest and befriended by seven dwarfs. They each have distinguishing qualities in which their names are based. Soon the Queen tricks Snow White into eating a poisonous apple leaving a Prince to break the spell with a kiss. This is problematic because the idea of an enchanted kiss is never explained but just accepted as a romantic notion. Beautifully animated with imaginative storytelling and directing by David Hand. Adriana Caselotti voices Snow White whose wakened kissed came before over the counter drugs. Lucille La Verne steals scenes as the evil Queen. The Prince is an absolute bore. The seven dwarfs are identified by their name glitches as oppose to personalities. The huntsman refuses to slay Snow White. The result is an enchanting landmark spectacular.

This soulless, cringeworthy abomination is a travesty that insults the very concept of storytelling. With a 1/10 rating from critics and audiences alike, it's clear that this movie is a complete and utter disaster.
The first issue is the script, which is a jumbled mess of clichés and poorly written dialogue. The characters are paper-thin, with Snow White herself being a blank slate with no discernible personality. The Seven Dwarfs are reduced to mere caricatures, with no depth or development. The villain, the Evil Queen, is a one-dimensional caricature with no motivation or backstory.
The acting is equally atrocious, with Rachel Zegler struggling to convey any sense of emotion or charisma. Her Snow White is a wooden, unengaging presence on screen, with all the charm and warmth of a damp sock. The supporting cast fares no better, with the usually reliable Gal Gadot and Ben Kingsley phoning in their performances.
The direction is equally uninspired, with Chris Buck and Marc Webb failing to bring any sense of wonder or magic to the proceedings. The action scenes are dull and uninspired, with the special effects looking like they were ripped straight from a video game. The music is forgettable and unmemorable, with none of the iconic songs from the original Disney classic making an appearance.
But perhaps the biggest problem with Snow White is its complete lack of originality. The story is a lazy retread of the original fairy tale, with no new twists or surprises to speak of.

tt0029583,rw10433827,Apireon,8/10 - A Magical Milestone of Film History,"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) is more than just a classic-it's a landmark in cinematic history. As the first full-length animated feature film, it was a monumental risk for Walt Disney, who invested nearly all of his studio's resources and reputation into its production. At derisively nicknamed ""Disney's Folly"" before its release, the film went on to become a global sensation, changing animation-and cinema-forever.
In stark contrast to the ill-fated 2025 live-action remake, which was heavily criticized for its lack of direction, soulless visuals, and incoherent messaging, the 1937 original remains a timeless piece of art. Where the remake falters under modern overcorrections and sterile digital production, the original thrives in its hand-crafted charm, narrative clarity, and emotional warmth.
From a visual standpoint, Snow White is breathtaking. The use of the multiplane camera brought depth and atmosphere to animated storytelling, making the forest feel alive, the Queen's castle looming, and the dwarfs' cottage warm and lived-in. The character animation-particularly of the dwarfs-is expressive, funny, and full of life. Grumpy, Dopey, and the rest remain enduring icons because their personalities are so clearly defined, even without much dialogue.
Snow White herself is a product of her time, yes-but her innocence and kindness serve as the emotional core of the film. The Evil Queen is still one of the most iconic villains in cinema, her transformation scene as chilling today as it was nearly 90 years ago.
The score, too, deserves praise-""Heigh-Ho,"" ""Someday My Prince Will Come,"" and ""Whistle While You Work"" are not just catchy tunes, but foundational pieces of the Disney musical formula that would influence generations.
Yes, the pacing may feel slower by today's standards, and Snow White's characterization might seem too naïve for modern sensibilities. But as a piece of film art, it's nearly flawless in intent and execution. It's cute, magical, and endearing in a way that no remake has yet managed to capture.",8.0,2025-04-05,2,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt0029583,rw2456457,classicsoncall,"""Well, once there was a princess"".","With this review, I've hit a goal I've been aiming for, that of reviewing every film on the American Film Institute's list of Top 100 Films which came out in 1997. I saved this for last because, let's face it, I'm a guy who's more at home with a good Western than a Disney fairy tale, and it would look pretty silly to be seen watching this picture by someone pulling up the driveway and looking though the bay window. So for this viewing, I grabbed my two year old granddaughter for cover, and casually mentioned to her mom and my wife that ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" was about to begin.

You know, I must have seen this as a kid because I remember a fair amount about it, especially the 'Heigh-Ho' song and the talking mirror business. Watching today I was a bit surprised by some of the scary elements in the story, starting off with the Evil Queen's command to the Huntsman to bring back the heart of Snow White in a box. I thought about that for some time, and then wondered what ever happened to the Huntsman. Someone spilled the beans about the pig heart gimmick, but the Queen never got her revenge as far as I could tell.

Since everyone knows the story, I'll mention some of the things I thought about in context of the picture's release in 1937. The term 'Jiminy Crickets' was used twice in the story, but the character of Jiminy Cricket didn't appear in a Disney picture until 1940's ""Pinocchio"". Up till then, using the term was sort of a sanitized way of taking the Lord's name in vain, sometimes exclaimed as 'Jiminy Christmas'. Judy Garland's character Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz"" says it when startled by the Wizard's lightning and thunder display - ""Oh! Oh! Jiminy Crickets!""

There's also the Evil Queen's use of a poisoned apple to put Snow White to sleep, reminiscent of the Bible story of Adam and Eve and the forbidden fruit. But the thing that really intrigued me was when my daughter questioned Snow White's brown eyes. I didn't think much of it until my wife joined the picture in progress about ten minutes later. She remarked on the same thing. It never occurred to me that Walt Disney avoided the blond, blue-eyed stereotype that seemed to be the characteristic of an ideal princess. I haven't read any other observations on this, so I'm just throwing it out there.

Anyway, as an animated classic, this one holds up pretty well after seventy plus years, paving the way for a Disney industry that's still going strong. Considering that the animation was all done by hand makes it even more amazing - the characters, the animals, the Seven Dwarfs all come to life in a magical way that enthralled my granddaughter, keeping her rapt attention until the very end.

tt0029583,rw1904592,Boba_Fett1138,Set the standards for all future animated movies.,"Of course one of the things about animated movies is that no matter when they got made they never look old. ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" got made in 1937 but it looks just as good and the same as Disney movies- and other full length animated movies that got made in much later decades. You can say that ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" was the movie that set the standards for animated movies and was a sign of things to come. It's also the reason why the movie won a special Academy Award for 'pioneering a great new entertainment field'. It was not awarded on simple Academy Award but also 7 smaller ones along with it. A nice and fitting tribute.
Even though it's the very first full length animated Disney feature it's also actually one of the most daring ones. Some moments are truly scary done and the movie features some real horror like moments and even a skeleton in a shocking scene. No way Disney movies would allow these sort of imagery these days. It shows they were still looking for the right style and approach for their movies at the Disney studios.
But it's funny to note how little the animation style had actually changed for the Disney movies over the years. Right till the '90's Disney movies used the same animation style and were just as good and smooth looking as this movie. It makes it all the movie obvious what a great accomplishment for 1937 this movie was. Not only the characters and their movies are looking fine but also the backgrounds and all of the other little details in it.
So it's not a movie that is outdated with its style but it of course is with its story. As a matter of fact ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" story is shockingly simply and there hardly is any story development. It also is disgustingly happy and friendly with all of the cuddly animals in it and the sweet character of Snow White herself. But yet this at the same time is definitely part of the charm of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"".
While the comedy is not as good or much present as would be the case in a Disney short, featuring Donald Duck or Mickey Mouse for example, it still is a very fun movie to watch, which is due to the overall atmosphere of the movie and the likability of the characters.
The characters from this movie are still among the best and most memorable ones out of all Disney movies. Not just Snow White herself but also obviously the seven dwarfs, who also make the movie mostly entertaining to watch. The Queen/Witch is also a good memorable Disney villain, even though her role is actually quite small in the movie.
Also this earliest Disney movie already featured songs in it. Some of them are still classics and it's must better stuff when compared to some Disney movies which got made in the first years after ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", with the exception of ""Pinocchio"", which was the first next big Disney project after this one.
Still just as good and watchable as it was at the time of its release.

tt0029583,rw0017053,Spleen,And I suppose `The Pickwick Papers' was Charles Dickens's best novel,"What was the first X-rated animated film?  Most people who have any kind of clue at all would say `Fritz the Cat', but they'd be wrong.  It's `Snow White'! - which received the equivalent of an X-rating in South Africa. (Parts of it ARE grisly, even if the Grimm brothers' story was more grisly still: in the story, the Queen asked for Snow White's lungs and liver - with the intention of eating them.)  This should dispel anyone's idea that the film is all cloying sentimentality.
Here's another one: `Gone with the Wind' was the biggest box office hit of the 1930s, but what was the second biggest?  Oh, well, I guess everyone here knows the answer to that one.  It must be said that the second-biggest hit deserved its success far more than the first.
`Snow White' can boast other things, too.  But let's not get carried away and say that in addition it's the BEST film of the 1930s, or the best animated film of all time, or Disney's supreme masterpiece, or something silly of that kind.  It clearly isn't any of these things.  Let's distinguish between `good considering that it's a first effort' and good simpliciter, and see how `Snow White' rates.
Many things are good simpliciter.  Although the visual spectacle is dwarfed by that of `Pinocchio' and `Fantasia' - to name but two - it's still visual spectacle, and it still works.  Some of the special effects can still startle us.  (I have absolutely no idea how they managed to get that shot of Snow White's reflection in well, for instance.)  The art direction vividly creates a world of cosy dwellings surrounded by choking forest.  The use of colour is as marvellous and subtle as anything the studio produced after 1942 (if not quite up to the standards set by `Fantasia' or `Bambi').  In fact, every single feature after `101 Dalmations' (1961) fails to measure up to `Snow White' so far as colour is concerned.  A muted, watercolour effect (achieved WITHOUT actual watercolours) is enlivened by the rare splash of brilliance on the Queen's cape or on the poisoned apple, but there's more to it than that.  Note how we're not shown a wide palette of colours until the dwarfs appear, when it seems that every hue under the sun makes its way onto the screen.  The dwarfs are the only rounded characters, representing, between them, all aspects of humanity.  (Brilliantly animated, by the way.) It's surprising, or perhaps it isn't, that in an age in which computers allow art directors to fiddle around with the colour balance as much as they like, no-one seems to be able to use colour nearly so effectively.
But there are also signs that the art wasn't yet ripe.  The most obvious one is the limited range: `Snow White' never does anything more than a particularly good pantomime might do (which is more than you might think), and while this isn't even a flaw, it does mean that the film simply can't compare with the broader masterpieces Disney produced immediately afterwards (`Pinocchio', `Fantasia', `Dumbo', `Bambi').  In 1937, Disney (and Hand and everyone else at the studio) still didn't know what to do to make a well-proportioned cartoon over an hour in length.  After the dwarfs have been around for a while the film starts to lose its way.  It even has to resort to title-card narration, indicating that while the first part of the story had been thought through properly, the rest hadn't been.  And there are minor technical difficulties throughout, with awkward animation of Snow White here, a clumsy use of the multiplane camera there.
Don't get me wrong.  It's a lovely film, among the better ones the studio has produced.  We do it no service when we exaggerate its virtues.",8.0,2000-01-04,4,4,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt0029583,rw0017119,The_Movie_Cat,"""A fine bunch of washers you lot turned out to be!""","I feel ashamed that I only watched Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in order so that my hard, cynical heart could launch itself into an anti-Disney rant. The most sentimental of the major cartoon studios, I was determined to ravage this one after seeing isolated, treacly clips.
Yet seen all together I have to admit that I was softened by a talented picture that is genuinely charming. The somewhat dated animation resembles cut outs from a picture book with its pastel hues, and looks and feels more natural than the angular, jerky computerised movement of the modern Disney features. It helps that they also employ someone who can actually sing in the titular role, with an operatic blend to the proceedings. And it would take the coldest of people not to warm to Snow White's genuine innocence. I concede, I did wince a little at the cutesy blue birds, but this is vastly more charming than I had been led to expect.
It's pacy, too: whereas some of the older Disney films tend to drag (I remember catching the aptly named Sleeping Beauty one Sunday afternoon), this one is suitably brisk in its portrayal of events. And while modern cartoons (or ""Animated Features"" as they pompously like to be known) blow up the role of the ""director"", this one really has its eye on cinematic technique. Just look at the early wishing well scene, shot from the perspective of the well bottom or the blend of images and dissolves when Snow White's in the forest.
Many of the songs are classics, of course. Whistle While You Work is still something you can find yourself humming or whistling while doing the hoovering, The greatest contention for me though was the seven dwarves, who always struck me as far too self-consciously cutesy and grating to really like. Yet, come on  It's Off To Work We Go is a belter, isn't it?
The actual plot, which is largely sidestepped to make way for the leisurely song sequences, is more than a little macabre. Even when Snow White's heart (her severed heart!) is substituted; it's replaced with a pig's heart... and all for a family audience. I'm not saying this one is morbid, but they deem Snow White (Or Snow, if we may call her that) so ""beautiful, even in death"" that they refuse to bury her and place her in a transparent coffin. In a parallel universe somewhere there's an offshoot of this movie where the Prince arrives too late and her rapidly decaying corpse turns into a flesh-eating zombie. Maybe they should do that as one of their special straight-to-video sequels  after all, they're grave robberies, aren't they?
It's a slightly strange plot, too, with Snow White spending the duration being plotted against by a bitter old Queen. And people say Elton John didn't get involved with Disney until The Lion King. Yet in order to elicit Snow White's trust she transforms herself into a scary-looking old hag? Why not just stay in her own image? And if she can transform her appearance like that, then why not use the same magic to make herself the sought-after ""fairest of them all""? Yet I guess if she didn't then we wouldn't have a story, and the apple ofference does have some religious connotations. This is a one-note plot, though, and subtext isn't the order of the day. Rather, it's the colour and flavouring of the piece that are there to be enjoyed, not the somewhat redundant narrative. And while, after the initial thrust, the film does lose momentum slightly, enjoy it I did, a delightful and wonderfully made cartoon. Yes, you can read into the white = good/black evil assertions, but for me I'd rather marvel at the songs and images, or make cheap jokes about MOR pianists.
Just two minor points: why are they called ""Dwarfs"" and not Dwarves in the film's title? And seven dwarves working in a mine? Is that an example of positive discrimination?",8.0,2004-04-04,6,8,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt0029583,rw9180945,HollisWoods,Walt Disney started something great,"Where do I even begin? During the opening credits, there's words of thanks from Walt Disney to the crew for the hard work and love put into the film. Watching Snow White - I feel that hard work and love. I feel the dreams Walt had when this movie was made. Aside from Mickey, it was Snow White that kick started the Disney Company as we know it, for better or for worse. If this movie failed, whose to say where we would be with out Walt Disney and all the achievements that came from his life and success - from film & animation to engineering to tourism. This was a beginning.
I know that these days, we all wanna be progressive. We're tired of seeing the damsel in distress. The guy doesn't have to get the girl every time; cut the romance. Give us a story, not a fairytale. And Disney films as of late have done such a good job of this, from Frozen to Zootopia to Turning Red. But sometimes, it's good to go back to basics and classic tales. Fairytales are timeless. Don't knock out the Brothers' Grimm just yet!
Snow White remains my favorite Disney Princess. She's so precious, pure, and lovely. I just wanna give her a big Hufflepuff hug. The Evil Queen also remains my favorite villain. Disneyland character interactions & Once Upon a Time have totally solidified this for me. The music is also iconic. One Song is amongst my favorites and Heigh-Ho is still a bop. The animation has also stood the test of time. I'd love to hear some behind the scene stories to learn what production was like. Overall, a classic & staple in Disney culture. While Snow's tale has been told soooooo many times, Disney's adaption is definitely amongst the best.",10.0,2023-07-10,2,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

tt0029583,rw1758201,TheUnknown837-1,there is something timeless and everlasting about movies like this,"""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", a film that has long been treasured and regarded with awe and amazement by audiences for seventy long years. Whether or not the viewer knows about the incredible painstaking work it took to make the animation in a film like this convincing enough for us, we do still look at the film and enjoy it despite the fact that its animation and style is far outdated. ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is short, wonderful, and unique. Had it been made today, it may not have worked out. First of all, it would have had to be longer and with more interaction between several of the characters.
However, there is something classic and timeless about ""Snow White"" which still works today. While I do strongly believe that the love story, although a major point in the plot, was exercised weakly onto the screen. The real reason for this is that the prince, whose name is never revealed, has such little screen time. I estimate about three minutes, maybe less. In my following research, I discovered that it was because of the incredible difficulty the animators found in drawing in frame-by-frame. That's how it was done back then.
Putting aside the flaw with the character of the prince, the other characters were very well-done with both animation and development. Snow White is well-realized in looking innocent, kind, and depending on one's point-of-view, a beautiful Disney character. The seven dwarfs, the other title characters, were also well-done and they are the real stars of the film. Snow White provides the drama and heart-felt sympathy, while the dwarfs provide everything else except for antagonism. But they are the characters who make us laugh, or at least grin. And each is given a specific personality which makes them memorable. The evil queen, the villain of the story, is one of the coldest that Disney studios ever pulled out. Whichever physical form she is in, the queen, also unnamed, is a ruthless baddie. Her horrifying personality and decisions ultimately earned her a place in the Top 50 Villains of film history.
So while ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is an old, outdated film which does not always meet the expectations of audience members today, there is something about it that does work. It has been selected for preservation by the Library of Congress. I myself think it is worthy of such a position. I don't really know why, it's just a wonderful animated film in its own right. I liked it as a kid. And recently, I saw it again for the first time in years. It proved out to be more effective than I thought it as going to be.

She plots to kill Snow White so that she can be the fairest, but as in all Disney animated classic, good will always win, and there's a handsome prince to help. This classic fairytale still holds up today, it's great animation, ESPECIALLY for 1937! It's very fun and entertaining, complete with catchy songs and well written characters like the dwarfs. The dwarfs are: Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey. They all of course behave exactly like their name and they work in a nearby mine, they stroll in single file every day singing their work song, hi ho hi ho..... Snow White stumbles upon them and their cottage and she begins to stay there with her while in hiding from the evil queen. The evil queen, who is a FANTASTIC Disney villain all the while is plotting a way to kill Snow White.

I have asked myself the question ""is this movie really 80 years old by now""? and the fact that it actually is still astounds me. In my lifetime the company has made movies which looked less than half as good as Snow White despite the available technology, therefore it has a special place in my heart.
But that said, I honestly think that Snow White as a character is quite a bore. She surely has the beautiful singing voice of Adriana Caselotti, but she is too cute and innocent to be interesting. In addition to that, the scenes involving her and the prince are just awkward, both of the times they meet. The dwarfs and the evil queen are by far the greatest characters in this movie.

The story over all is charming, I like that her love interest is a normal boy, rom the way people talked about this movie I didnt think there would be a love interest but there is and they have a lovely chemistry. It does have some moments where things don't connect story wise but like what movie doesn't just wish I understood more what the dwarfs did in the end. Rachel Zegler's performance and voice, OMG her voice, definitely a highlight of this film, no notes her signing was flawless. Gal Gadot's performance was a little stiffer then I expected, not bad just not what I expected since she was amazing in Wonder Woman, but she's a wicked witch so maybe it was a story choice.

tt0029583,rw8544216,moviesfilmsreviewsinc,Truly A Disney classic and can't remake it.,"If Walt Disney's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" had been primarily about Snow White, it might have been forgotten soon after its 1937 premiere, and treasured today only for historical reasons, as the first full-length animated feature in color. Snow White is, truth to tell, a bit of a bore, not a character who acts but one whose mere existence inspires others to act. The mistake of most of Disney's countless imitators over the years has been to confuse the titles of his movies with their subjects. ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is not so much about Snow White or Prince Charming as about the Seven Dwarfs and the evil Queen--and the countless creatures of the forest and the skies, from a bluebird that blushes to a turtle who takes forever to climb up a flight of stairs. So complex were his frames, indeed, that Disney and his team of animators found that the cels they used for their short cartoons were not large enough to contain all the details he wanted, and larger cels were needed. The film's earliest audiences may not have known the technical reasons for the film's impact, but in the early scene where Snow White runs through the forest, they were thrilled by the way the branches reached out to snatch at her, and how the sinister eyes in the darkness were revealed to belong to friendly woodland animals. The trees didn't just sit there within the frame. ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" was immediately hailed as a masterpiece. (The Russian director Sergei Eisenstein called it the greatest movie ever made.) It remains the jewel in Disney's crown, and although inflated modern grosses have allowed other titles to pass it in dollar totals, it is likely that more people have seen it than any other animated feature. The word genius is easily used and has been cheapened, but when it is used to describe Walt Disney, reflect that he conceived of this film, in all of its length, revolutionary style and invention, when there was no other like it--and that to one degree or another, every animated feature made since owes it something.",10.0,2022-09-15,2,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt6208148,rw10395396,imdbfan-2544876146,A Grimm Disaster That Should've Stayed Asleep,"The latest Snow White reboot is an absolute trainwreck, a cinematic disaster so bafflingly bad it makes you wonder who greenlit this mess. From the opening scene, it's clear the filmmakers decided to ditch charm, coherence, and anything resembling the original tale for a gritty, overproduced slog that nobody asked for. The dwarves? Replaced with a crew of edgy, leather-clad ""guardians"" who look like they wandered off the set of a low-budget dystopian flick. Snow White herself is a brooding anti-hero who spends half the movie scowling at the camera and delivering lines like, ""I don't need a prince-I am the storm."" Cringe-worthy doesn't even begin to cover it.

The plot is a chaotic jumble of forced modern twists-think evil queen as a misunderstood CEO, a magic mirror that's now an AI chatbot with a sassy attitude, and apples swapped for some nonsensical ""poison crystal"" subplot that goes nowhere. The pacing is atrocious: it drags through endless monologues about empowerment, then sprints through a climax so rushed you'll miss it if you blink. The CGI is somehow both over-the-top and cheap-looking-those forest scenes look like they were rendered on a laptop from 2010.

The acting? Rachel Zegler tries her best as Snow White, but she's saddled with dialogue so wooden it could double as kindling. The supporting cast is forgettable at best, phoning it in at worst. And don't get me started on the soundtrack-generic pop ballads that sound like they were rejected from a TikTok playlist.

tt0029583,rw3247905,Vartiainen,The start of something wonderful,"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is one of the most influential films in history. The first full-length animated film, for a few brief years the highest-grossing film of all time and still to this day one of the most successful films in Disney history. Still the most successful if you account for inflation. And there is a reason for all that success, and not just the fact that it was the first. It's the crown of Walt Disney Studios. There might be gems that shined brighter later on, but this is the base, the foundation of the studio's brilliance.
And no, it's not a perfect film. You can still see that the animators were still learning away from the brief animated shorts they were more used to doing. The whole film is very episodic, with most of the time spent on general gallivanting and merriment. Especially with the dwarfs. There's a whole segment dedicated to them washing their hands. Actually, I lie. There's a whole segment AND a song dedicated to it. And sure, the dwarfs are great character, each a unique personality with hiccups and all, so the viewer doesn't really mind that the plot is pretty much forgotten much of the time, but you can nevertheless see that it's a work in progress as far as feature length storytelling is concerned.
Luckily we have the Queen. And oh, what a way to introduce us to Disney villains. To this day she's one of the greats and it can be argued that the movie is actually about her, not Snow White nor the dwarfs. She's the first character we see, has pretty much the most dialogue and her scenes are the most captivating and actually move the plot forward. And she's a menace. Always plotting, scheming, cackling, being absolutely terrifying. The first look she gives us after her transformation is one of the scariest looks in cinema history.

tt0029583,rw4588845,BusaLeLizweBo,One of the most revolutionary films ever created,"""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is at the same time the first Disney animated feature and the first feature-length animated film of all time. Without it, who knows of we'd ever get animation as we know it today, since these things were unimaginable back then. And that alone makes it worthy of some mad respect! And the fact that it holds up so well to this day only furthers that point.
Now, I like 3D animation, but I prefer the old-school, 2D animation style. And this really looks gorgeous, especially considering the time it was made. There's not as much work put into backgrounds compared to some later Disney films, but the backgrounds still look like paintings anyway. The movements look pretty nice too, except for the prince looking a bit odd, but supposedly he was really hard to animate. The characters themselves are pretty likeable too. Some might find Snow White annoying because of her high-pitched voice, but I think she's adorable. This Snow White is THE Snow White, as she will probably be the first to come to mind when you mention the character. And while there might be seven of the dwarfs, not one of them feels pushed aside and each one manages to have his own distinct personality in less than 90 minutes, which is kind of an amazing achievement when you think about it. One (Grumpy) even has a character arc which actually enhances the emotion largely in some scenes near the end, I'd go as far to say that he's the overlooked emotional drive of the third act, just not put into focus of the situation. Let's take a look at the human characters now. Snow White is a Mary Sue, there's no denying that. But this was the first Disney princess, I think we can forgive that. Same goes for The Prince, but he's actually barely in the movie, so does it really matter? The Evil Queen is such an iconic villain in both of her forms throughout the movie and sets a high bar for Disney villains yet to come, a bar that still managed to be surpassed. The Huntsman has something unique to him as well, but he's not much in the movie either. There is, however, one side character that I found very mysterious and intriguing: The Magic Mirror. It's creepy, has an incredible design and oozes with mystery. The story is pretty thin and slowed down by random scenes that feel like filler, but hey, they are a fun filler that helps develops the personalities of each of the dwarves. And keep in my mind that Disney was starting out with storytelling, so it needed some time to improve. However, this movie isn't so much about what is done, it's about how it's done.

tt0029583,rw9441361,barry-ahlers,Ahead of its time,"Imagine traveling back in time to the 1950s and going to a movie theater that's playing some awful z-grade sci-fi/horror film. Now take that film out of the projector and replace it with Jurassic Park. Can you imagine the absolute terror and panic that would grip the audience? And they thought Frankenstein was scary!
While people may not think much of Snow White today, and some even find it offensive, it's best to try to imagine yourself, not at home in front of your giant TV streaming it on Disney+ and quietly (or loudly) judging it, but as part of a cinema crowd in 1937, who has only seen mostly black and white animated shorts, and not a feature length animated film in full color and what seem to be real life three dimensions. For a 1937 audience a movie like this may have caused some anxiety and panic, as well as excitement and a sense of wonder that every good filmmaker aspires to. It may have felt like Walt Disney had brought this film from the future, but we now know the he was pretty much inventing the future of animated film.
Because he took a short fairy tale and lengthened it out to a feature film, Snow White had a lot of ""filler."" But that filler, for me, makes up the most memorable parts. My favorite example is the washing up before dinner scene. It comes with a cute and catchy song and a dozen sight gags. It didn't really move the plot forward, but who cares? It really let you know a lot about these hardworking mine workers.
If you're a fan of Encanto or any other modern animated Disney (or Pixar, or DreamWorks) film, just remember that none of them would have happened without Walt Disney first breaking all these technical barriers and bringing the simplest of fairy tales to life.
Maybe it hasn't stood the test of time in regards to modern sensibilities (the stolen kiss, for example), but it still looks as good as, and sometimes better than, traditionally animated films of the 21st century.",10.0,2023-11-18,2,1,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

She's not perfect but really who is?

As a piece of history, of course this movie is unparalleled. Everyone knows all the achievements and advancements that came from it. I will give my undying gratitude to Snow White for starting the undisputed greatest tradition in film history.

And honestly, for turning 70 this year, the old dame's held up pretty well. No, it has never been my favourite Disney fairy tale, but it has far more merits than detriments.

OK, OK the titular character is about as flat as the paper she's drawn on , gratingly dense, and there's no accounting for taste when choosing the voice (It feels like they were honestly going for 12 years old, which just disturbs contemporary audiences). And the animators definitely showed their weakness when it came to the prince, HOWEVER, the rest is superb. The forest and anything involving the Queen are genuinely terrifying. Many scenes I could not endure when I was little without throwing back my head and howling. So much care and individual quirks are put into the dwarfs. I put my old VHS copy in not too long ago and was completely taken back by how funny some of their stuff is. I was not expecting it to retain that much entertainment value.

So all in all, we all know SWSD is a historical piece of blah blah blah, but I think we've forgotten that beyond that, it really is a good movie. Like what they say about good wines, it only gets better with age.

tt0029583,rw10151686,RevanMandalore2025,"The First of Many for Disney, Imperfect yet Timeless","For my very first review on this site, I figured-why not start with Disney's very first animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?

What more can anyone say about this animated classic, nearly a century after its release? It's the movie that faced all the odds, had countless doubters, and yet went the distance, more than earned its place in cinematic history and laid the groundwork for Disney's enduring legacy of animation for generations to come.

The Animation: Good ol'-fashioned 2D animation that's incredibly impressive for the 1930s. Fluid and colorful, it's filled with scenes of joy and heart but isn't afraid to get dark and scary when needed. While it shows its age in places-especially with the slightly awkward facial rotoscoping on Snow White herself, nothing can detract from the blood, sweat, and tears the animators poured into proving that a full-length animated feature could succeed.

The Princess Herself: Compared to modern Disney princesses, with all their nuances and complexities, Snow White's a simpler character. Yet that simplicity works in her favor. She's a genuinely nice, kind, and loving soul-the kind of character you wish we saw more of in the world today. Adriana Caselotti did a wonderful job bringing this beautiful character to life. While she deserved far more recognition and respect from Disney, her performance remains immortal.

The Prince: I wouldn't blame you if you forgot about him-there's not much to say other than...he's nice. He's not exactly bad, just...alright. Perhaps his simplicity was intentional, a way to complement the film's greater strengths while serving as the kind-hearted man Snow White needed.

The Dwarfs: These guys steal the whole show, hands down. Each one has a unique charm, and together they're endlessly entertaining. My personal favorites are Dopey, with his adorably innocent antics, and Grumpy, whose heart shines through by the end.

The Villain: Holy cow, Disney! What a way to kick off your legacy of iconic villains. The Evil Queen is cruel, vain, and selfish enough to want her own stepdaughter dead. First, she demands Snow White's heart in a box. Then, she concocts the infamous poisoned apple-all to destroy one of the gentlest, most loving characters imaginable. Despicable! And yet, she commands a memorable presence, perfectly balancing fear and menace-even in her disguise as an old hag.

The Soundtrack: The music works on every level, from Snow White's sweet songs to the iconic Heigh-Ho anthem of the Dwarfs. The orchestral score adds atmosphere and wonder, enriching the story at every turn. Not a single note feels out of place, it's a perfect example of how a soundtrack can elevate a movie.

Everything Else: The movie balances humor and heart beautifully (who knew Snow White had sass?), with fantastic voice acting all around. It radiates a wholesome charm that countless films today spend hours trying to replicate, and this film does it in just 83 minutes.

Is it perfect?

Heck no, no film is. But the sum of its parts, each wonderful on its own, far outweighs any flaws. As Disney's very first animated feature, Snow White took bold, imperfect first steps when most believed audiences wouldn't sit through a full-length cartoon. In hindsight, those first steps helped pave the way for countless masterpieces to come.

Give it a chance-you might be surprised by its charm, or maybe you'll find it tame and dated. For me, though, it's a timeless piece of work that will stand strong for generations to come.",8.0,2024-11-23,2,1,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt0029583,rw4195626,FilmRunner,"Well, here is the film that started an empire.","Well, here is the film that started an empire. Not only was it Walt Disney's first foray into feature length animated films, it was also the first full length cell animated film ever attempted. I suppose it's needless to say that the gamble paid off for him. Especially when you take into account the fact that Disney, after just buying 20th Century Fox entertainment, now technically owns about a third of the entertainment industry.
Walt Disney first came across the tale of Snow White when he was about fifteen years of age after reading The Brothers Grimm tale of the same name. He later stated that he couldn't get the story out of his head and he would be constantly playing the story over in his mind. After the success of his Mickey Mouse and the Silly Symphonies series, Walt pooled everyone together and started work on Snow White in early 1934. The film was finally released in December 1937, and received a standing ovation from an audience containing that of Judy Garland. Snow White went on to do exceptionally well at the box office, and in 1939 became the top grossing sound film of all-time.
Snow White at the start of the tale has been forced into the life of a scullery maid. This is being enforced by her incredibly jealous and equally vain stepmother, the Queen. This obstinately vain monarch is particularly fixated with being the fairest in the land and believes her beautiful stepdaughter, Snow White, to be a growing threat to her. Her worst fears are realised when the Queens magic mirror declares Snow White to be the fairest in the land. Overcome with jealousy, the Queen hires a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. The huntsman however is struck by Snow White's innocence and beauty, and tells her to flee into the forest in order to escape the Queens wrath. There she bumps into a company of dwarves, all with distinctive personalities and loveable quirks. The dwarves allow her to stay after learning she's on the run and especially after learning that she can cook and clean (I don't think sexism was a big thing in the 1930's unfortunately). Meanwhile, the Queen is hatching more maniacal schemes to find and kill Snow White.
Snow White as a lead serves her purpose well enough. These days however she pales in comparison with Disney's latest and more stronger and self-sufficient movie heroines, such as: Moana and Frozen's Anna and Elsa. Since Snow White's only noticeable qualities is her uncommonly kind nature, naivety, and Betty Boop esc singing voice (which is also a little dated). She tends to come off a bit bland, but fortunately the dwarves more than make up for the leads short comings, and outright steal the show. The dwarves themselves all have different personalities, which are reflected in their names, in their timeless designs and exquisitely differing animations. The stand out has to be Dopey, his animation and musical cues made me chuckle a good few times. The dwarves serve as the charm and heart of the film, of which I am sure, has played a big part in this films continued success amongst children even today. I've heard a few people say in their reviews that they didn't think the Queen was a very effective villain. I can understand that point of view, especially since some of her schemes are not the cleverest. However when I watched the film as a kid I found the Queen to be absolutely terrifying, especially when she disguises herself as the old crone. I am pretty sure that I had nightmares over that old crone, and that for me has to show a definite level of effectiveness to a villain. The first thing for me that stands out is the terrific design. She looks menacing and intimidating as the queen, with her tall slender frame and pointed features. While her truly frightening design, as the old crone, allows the character to reveal her evil and deceitful ways. There is one character who gets cast aside and receives basically no development at all, and that would be the prince. He shows up a bit at the beginning and then again for the finale at the end. The problem with this is they have no interaction with each other in-between these events. This makes the relationship between the two characters very unbelievable by modern standards. Perhaps if he was given some more scenes to expand his personality a bit, or maybe even a name, his appearance at the end would not have been so jarring.
The musical numbers for the most part are brilliant and truly timeless; such as ""Heigh-Ho"". This particular tune is extremely hard to get out of your head once it's ingrained itself in there. However the ""I'm Wishing / One Song"" and most others sung by Snow White herself have a tendency to sound a little dated, and as I mentioned before, a bit Betty Boop like.
When I re-watched the film for this review, I couldn't help but be amazed by the extraordinarily lifelike animation that Disney and his incredible animation team had achieved. I hadn't watched the movie for a very long time and for some reason expected the animation to be, not bad, but dated compared to the more recent animated movies. Boy was I wrong. Eighty years on and it still looks practically flawless. There's nothing better than watching true masters of their craft and Disney's animators are in top form here.
Apart from occasionally showing its age and having some key characters shockingly underdeveloped. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is an enduring classic that will most likely be passed down for generations to come. If you're looking to entertain your nostalgic side a bit. Or perhaps looking into the origins of modern day animation and cinema, or maybe even trying to entertain your children for a couple of hours, there is not many finer options out there than this Disney classic.",9.0,2018-06-08,1,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

tt0029583,rw1708685,Beta_Gallinger,The beginning of the Disney motion pictures,"Walt Disney produced many full-length animated features during his long career, and many more have come from the Walt Disney Company since his death in 1966. However, the very first of them all was ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", an adaptation of the version of the story from the Brothers Grimm. This 1937 motion picture turned out to be groundbreaking, and although seven decades have passed since its original release, it is still remembered as a classic, well-deservingly!
Snow White is a princess, and the stepdaughter of the evil, vain Queen. One day, when the Queen asks her Magic Mirror ""Who is the fairest one of all?"", she doesn't get her usual response! Instead, she learns that Snow White is now the ""fairest one of all""! The Queen immediately grows jealous, and sends a hunter out to kill Snow White! Luckily for the princess, the hunter decides that killing her just wouldn't be right. Wanting her to live, he tells her to run away, which is just what she does. Looking for a place to stay, she ends up in the house of the Seven Dwarfs (Dopey, Sleepy, Sneezy, Doc, Bashful, Grumpy, and Happy), and begins to live with them. Meanwhile, after the Queen learns that Snow White is still alive, she intends to do the killing herself!
This was one of many Disney films that I saw when I was a kid, but my memory of it wasn't as clear as some of the others. A few months ago, I watched it for the first time in many years, and didn't think much of it. However, I was more impressed when I watched it again shortly after, and even more impressed with a third viewing! I found Snow White's singing voice somewhat annoying at first, and with more viewings, I still didn't become a big fan of it. However, this certainly didn't totally ruin the film for me. ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" has some good dialogue (some of which I may not have noticed before), excitement, and memorable characters (including Snow White, even if she's not the greatest character in Disney history, along with most of the Dwarfs, who often add humour to the film).
After my most recent viewing, I'm not sure whether to give ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" an 8 or a 9 (out of 10, of course). I certainly wouldn't give it a 10 (it's not absolutely perfect in my book), but I was very impressed with most of it. I don't know whether it was enough for me to give it a 9 rating or not. Well, nonetheless, I can still understand why this first full-length piece of animation from Disney has been labelled a classic by so many people throughout the decades!

Full kudos to all the animators and colouring folks that were involved, they truly did create something that is timeless and will live on for generations to come.

They've often overlooked in favour of Disney's renaissance in the 90's.

tt0029583,rw5022326,frankde-jong,Disneys ultimate classic,"""Snowwhite and the seven dwarfs"" was in 1937 a great leap forward in animation. It was the first feauture length animation movie and there were also some technical innovations. Not the least of them was the multiplane camera, which made it possible to film up to seven layers of animation at the same time. These layers could even move at different speed. As a result is was possible to make animation movies with much more visual depth.
Snowwhite and Prince charming maybe the main characters, they are too perfect to be interesting. The seven dwarfs, with al their (all too human) imperfections are much more fun to watch. In this respect they resemble the travel companions of Dorothy in ""The wizard of Oz"" (1939, Victor Fleming & King Vidor)
Just like in the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood Snowwhite contains symbolism that stand for the sexual awakening of a young girl. Think of the magic sleep and the kiss of the prince that breaks the spell. We also see the same symbolism in the Wagner opera ""Ring des Nibelungen"" (Brunhilde = Snowwhite and Siegfried = the Prince).
Apart from the sexual symbolism there is also some Biblical symbolism in the movie. Think about the number of dwarfs. Seven has always been a magical number in the Bible (the creation of the earth in seven days, the seven seals in the Book of Revelation).

While the film attempts to update the themes and characters for a contemporary audience, it ultimately sacrifices the heart and magic that made the original so beloved.
One of the most glaring issues is the weak writing. The dialogue often feels forced, with characters delivering lines that seem more focused on making a statement than advancing the story naturally. The plot itself is a far cry from the whimsical charm of the original, coming across as overly complicated yet emotionally hollow.
The casting decisions, while bold, fail to deliver. The lead performance lacks the charisma and warmth required to carry the film, making it difficult to connect with the character. Even the supporting cast struggles to shine, with underwhelming portrayals of iconic roles that feel uninspired and forgettable.
Visually, the film is a mixed bag. While some scenes boast impressive production design, others are marred by unconvincing CGI that detracts from the overall experience. The cinematography fails to capture the enchanting, storybook-like quality one would expect from a Snow White adaptation.
Perhaps the most disappointing aspect is the lack of emotional resonance. Where the original thrived on themes of love, kindness, and courage, this version feels more like a lifeless attempt to tick off boxes of modern trends rather than a heartfelt retelling.
Overall, the new Snow White feels like a shallow, uninspired attempt to cash in on nostalgia while alienating fans of the original.

Although Disney had made animated movies and tv shows prior to Snow White, it did not have nearby as much success as before. One to notice was that the art in the film had a lot more effort put into, was much more detailed, and was hand drawn. The time it tool to draw every single scene was worth it as it resulted in beautiful and stunning scenes of the forest, cottage, and castle. What was most entertaining to listen to were the songs that were sung like Heigh-Ho and Whistle while you work. These two songs especially became popular and catchy to sing to and naturally became iconic over the years. I believe this contributed to the international love for Disney princesses movies that always had to have a beloved soundtrack that would remain timeless. The instruments in the film played a huge role in shifting the mood for the audience when she was lost in the forest too discovering the adorable cottage of the Dwarves. The sound reflected the emotions of the scenes every time such as when the animals were scared or happy. It added to the experience of watching it in theaters while keeping up with the plot.

Many animals also appear. The characters are cute and comical, and their features are well drawn.
And we must not forget the animation. The carefully drawn trees are impressive, and the roughness of the rain is astonishing. The reflections of the water and the bubbles are so well drawn that it is hard to believe that they were drawn by hand.

tt0029583,rw10004121,gkeith_1,Scary and nice.,"Spoilers. Opinions. Observations. Reflections.

In original story before Disney and the Grimm Brothers, the real mother (not the stepmother) wanted to kill Snow White because of jealousy, but audiences could not have accepted this.

I study original medieval fairy tales, but they may have been based upon real life when murder of children may have been commonplace. Perhaps they got in the way or ate too much food.

I have a university history degree, and have studied medieval and Renaissance beliefs and superstitions. Many people could not read, and children tended to be uneducated.

This was from an ancient Germanic folk tale possibly based upon an amalgam of real people. Maybe the real Snow White was from a poor family (which was the majority norm), and not noble or aristocratic.

Scary and nice. Nice colors. Nice music. Beautiful queen and ugly old woman. Great artwork and design. A triumph of good over evil.

I feel that this is a glorious film, and a stunning presentation.

tt0029583,rw0017081,Jeremy Bristol,A beautiful movie with great set pieces,"I'm with a lot of people, in that I think Snow White as a character is too much of a stereotype to be really interesting, but at least she's not the princess in Gulliver's Travels!
What really makes this movie is the artistic animation, which does exactly what animation is supposed to do: create feelings through moving images, not create a realistic world.  When Snow White flees into the forest, we see what she sees--that the whole world is suddenly out to get her.  The trees come to life in demonic fashion, and the floating logs become crocodiles.
A note on the songs--while today in America it seems kind of silly to have songs about working and cleaning, work songs have been a part of nearly every culture throughout history.  If you watch the subtitled version of Hayao Miyazaki's ""Princess Mononoke"" or Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai,"" you will hear examples of Japanese work songs.",8.0,2002-03-02,2,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

tt0029583,rw10193360,StudentYu,ctva 310 review,"This is a classic animated film, but it is my first time watching it. Although it was in 1937, I still found it interesting. The scene that impressed me the most was when Snow White fled into the forest. Everything in the forest around her starts to distort and turn into something terrifying. I have to say this scene is incredibly smooth and expressive, and I think it showcases animation's potential to the best. This level of expression is something that would be difficult to achieve with live action. Besides that, although the princess's character is a little bit flat. I found the character setting of the seven dwarfs very interesting. They have distinct personalities and names that match their personalities. In this way, even though there are seven of them, I never get them mixed up. This feature also fits with its positioning as a children's fairy tale film. I was especially impressed by the character dwarf Grumpy. The character's journey from hostility to accepting Snow White shows a transformation and growth, which is a character arc. Apart from that, I also found the movements of the animated characters and their interactions with the animals in the movie smooth. I don't know much about animation production. The exaggerated movements of those characters also can attract children's attention, and it make it a successful children's animated film. The only thing I don't like about this film is that the character of Snow White is too flat. She seems to be only responsible for beauty and kindness, with no depth to her character.",8.0,2024-12-15,2,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

tt0029583,rw6508384,gab-14712,Disney's First Animated Film!,"Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is more than just a classic. It is a movie, which was released in 1937, that changed the style of filmmaking, particularly within the world of animation. Prior, animation was just seen as a bunch of gags pushed together with talking ducks to keep the kids occupied for several minutes before the main feature. Mr. Disney himself drastically changed that notion. In addition to be the first full-length animated film in color, the film also introduced some very important technical techniques. Even with the hubbub surrounding the historical nature of the film, I feel like it is important to note the film is legitimately a good one. The story is basic and simple, but the characters are well-developed, the songs are great (and would set a standard for future Disney flicks), and the film is still great to look at-especially the sequence involving Snow White's dash to the forest, which still manages to freak me out (something modern horror films often fail to do).

The film entered development in 1934. Prior to this project, Disney and his company focused on simple, short features such as the Mickey Mouse series. Then, Disney came up with the idea to create the first animated feature-length flick. There was lots of pushback including from his brother and business partner, Roy Disney. During pre-production and all the way until the film's release, the unfortunate nickname was ""Disney's Folly."" The budget exceeded a million dollars, which was an incredible amount of money for the time. Disney even had to put down a mortgage on his house to help pay for the costs. I bet those people wish they could take back the negative comments now.

During production, a new technique or illusion if you will called ""the multiplane camera"" was invented which is the process of placing several layers of drawings and moving each layer at a different speed, which gives off the illumination that the background is moving. It gave the animation process a sense of realism and was used until computers came along. Also, the creative team, which used cels to create their cartoons, needed larger cels to fit Disney's vision. Of course, this would add to the basic footprint for future animation films.

The story itself is based off the fairytales written by the Grimm Brothers. A very simple story in which Disney did not want to just focus on Snow White, but mainly the background and gave each character an importance to the story, which is why the dwarves are a huge standout. Of course, you know the names (Doc, Grumpy, etc), and he wanted to detail each dwarf by each of their names, almost like caricatures you see in the newspapers. And one cannot help saying ""ooooohhh"" and ""awwww"" at the very helpful animals. So, in short, the production did a great job with the visualization of the film.

As for the story goes, the treacherous and evil queen hires the huntsman to take Snow White deep into the woods and murder her. Why, you may ask? The queen is simply afraid that the beauty of Snow White (voiced by Adriana Caselotti in her only acting role) would surpass hers. Thanks to an act of kindness, the huntsman spares Snow White's life. She stumbles upon the humble abode of the dwarves and makes herself at home. The dwarves are surprised by her visit, but they decide to take her in. When the queen gets wind of her being alive, she decides to personally pay Snow White a visit...with a poisoned apple.

The music definitely set a high standard for future Disney (or animated films for that matter). Disney's music team created memorable hits such as the lovely ""Heigh-Ho."" In fact, this is the first time that a soundtrack was ever released with a film. Prior, many studios did not really care about a musical companion for their films. The award-winning songs and their popularity did change some minds!

It is easy to see why Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a classic, but its more than a classic. It is a movie that changed the world of animation. It goes from a short, kid-friendly series of shorts to a film behemoth that inspired millions of adults and children. If you like Pixar or modern Disney films, you have Walt Disney to thank. He and his creative team took the world by surprise with this movie's success. At its heart, it is just a beautifully-animated feature with great music, stunning visual sequences that still manages to make the heart jump, and a memorable albeit simple story. The film is not just about Snow White, but it is also about the dwarves, the wretched Queen, and the cuddly animals. The dwarves really stole the show, with Grumpy being the most-developed dwarf (and my favorite). Historical footnotes aside, I recommend the film on sole merits of the film itself.

tt0029583,rw3821333,JohnHowardReid,One of the Seven Wonders of the Cinema!,"Nowadays it's hard to imagine the impact, the popularity and the fascination cartoons and comic strips had for the American public — especially in the Golden Years from around 1930 to 1950. ""All newspapers have news, but only one newspaper has The Gumps!"" proudly proclaimed The Chicago Sun (and scores of affiliated newspapers across the country). Such a slogan would be meaningless to 99% of today's readers (and absolutely risible to the other 1%).

Since the 1950s, cartoons and comic strips have generally been regarded as third-rate fodder for children. However, there are always riders to every sweeping statement. The exceptions here are Fantasia (especially in its 1970's re-issue when it was taken up by the hallucinogenic generation) and ""L'il Abner"" which enjoyed a surprising bout of adult popularity in the 1960s and 1970s.

In my childhood days, the comic strip and the comic book were regarded as less than praiseworthy amusements that older children were encouraged to out-grow; and the theatrical cartoon was a mindless diversion for backward youngsters whose limited attention spans were incapable of taking in a whole feature like Lassie Come Home or National Velvet.

In my home town, the situation was even worse. There was never a cult following for Tex Avery, and adult cartoons like Fritz the Cat fell flat at the box-office.

Despite his macabre humor, Disney was always regarded as strictly for kids. Adults couldn't care less whether Mickey Mouse had three fingers or four, whether Bambi lost a hundred mothers, whether Snow White lived or died. Because I loved cartoons, I was regarded as brain-damaged or eccentric. Often I found myself the lone adult in an audience of irritable children who found films like ""Dumbo"" way above their heads.

I have similar happy memories of Pinocchio, Alice in Wonderland, Gay Purree, The Lady and the Tramp, Ichabod and Mr Toad and Mr Bug Goes To Town. (Hey There, It's Yogi Bear, and A Man Called Flintstone, I loathed. I felt they were designed for mental zombies!)

However, the animated feature I love best of all is Snow White. It's a film I can enjoy over and over. Snow White herself may be a bit pallid, but the Wicked Queen and the seven dwarfs are brilliantly characterized. The songs are a joy, the animation often dazzlingly inventive, the colors and compositions a visual delight. The story has pace, charm, atmosphere, humor and excitement. If you are immune to its call, and if its music doesn't stir your soul, you're missing one of the seven wonders of the cinema.",10.0,2017-10-03,1,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt0029583,rw8719191,mark.waltz,Still a touching classic beyond words.,"Disney's first full length classic animated film, now at 85 years old, is the epitome of what classic animation has strive to be since it was filmed. It's obvious that even ""The Wizard of Oz"" was influenced by this in many ways even though that was a live action film and this is a cartoon. Lucille La Verne is an actress whose name has faded to history, but those who research the film will be surprised to discover that she was once a very famous stage actress who even had a Broadway theater named after her for a short time. For classic movie fans, she'll be always remembered as hag characters in two French revolution-based classics, ""Orphans of the Storm"" and ""A Tale of Two Cities"", and is well known to me for playing memorable supporting roles in ""Little Caesar"", ""Pilgrimage"", and a larger part as a loveable Southern matron in the Wheeler and Woolsey comedy ""Kentucky Kernels"". She is sensational in the voiceover role of both the wicked queen and the hag at the end, with photography of her aged face used as the influence for the drawings which created the character in the last part of this film. Watching her in those two French Revolution classics makes it obvious that her appearance was used in the creation of the old hag who brings Snow White a poisoned apple.

It's obvious that kids who watched this when it first came out and in subsequent re-releases were frightened by the horror elements of the film which obviously influenced a great HBO movie featuring Sigourney Weaver as the wicked queen. Other movie versions of the Snow White tale have not been as successful, nor several misguided appearances on the Oscars. Adriana Caselotti provides both the acting and singing voice of Snow White, her voice perhaps a little shrill for modern audiences, but the light operatic style was definitely popular when this was made. Harry Stockwell's singing voice reminds me of Allan Jones who was quite popular in 1937, having had a big hit that year with ""The Donkey Serenade"". Other voices are perfect as well, including the magic mirror, the huntsman and of course those adorable seven dwarfs.

So while they're definitely are some elements of this that are extremely corny, corn is one of the sweetest vegetables out there, and the animated animals are quite cute. This film grips you from the very beginning and never let go, and it's easy to see that the structure of the film would continue in other animated classics made beyond the living Walt Disney era into the decades after. This is one of those films that even the most cynical of adults can watch again years after first seeing it and begin to whistle as they watch while Snow White is whistling while she works. And of course there's the classic ""Heigh Ho"" song that totally stands the test of time. This is the type of film that if possible I would rate far beyond perfect, that if you end up in a sentimental mood while viewing it, tears are bound to follow, both out of the joy that this film provides and the sadness that they just don't make films like this anymore.",10.0,2022-12-06,1,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt0029583,rw8593773,flaviomarcelo,Snow White's Odyssey,"Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs is a movie where we see her stepmother the evil queen ask the mirror who is the most beautiful in the kingdom, and without hesitation the mirror tells her that Snow White to which the queen feels jealous and sends her to kill with a woodcutter who, as a sign that he fulfilled his mandate, asks for Snow White's heart (so far the evil queen takes the credit because she is a very imposing character and really evil, she is very well built, by giving her a goal of wanting to finish with Snow White and being the most beautiful of all; Snow White on the other hand is a very sweet character and does not see evil in people despite being an employee, she starts singing with animals; the appearance of the beginning is like something ambiguous, I felt which was forced by making him appear out of nowhere, it's like ""Where did he come from? What was he doing there?), then the woodcutter goes looking for Snow White and tries to kill him but he can't and asks him to run away because the queen wants to kill him , listening char eso Snow White flees with all her might until she hallucinate that everything around her wants to attack her (So far it seems crazy to me how Disney made that scene by giving it a macabre touch, like the desperation of the character itself) seeing that it was an illusion of her head comes across the house of the dwarfs, she knocks on the door and seeing no one decides to go in, she starts to clean with her singing animals (I love that scene how the soundtrack goes to the rhythm of the animation and that everything looks like a party at cleaning time), Snow White feels tired and decides to go to sleep, some time passes and the dwarfs at work begin to sing the iconic song. Seeing that it was lunch time they decide to leave, when they get home they find everything clean changed and with the food cooking, they decide to go investigate and send the funny tontin (my favorite character, so innocent and charismatic) they get scared and decide running when Snow White wakes up they see that she is a very beautiful woman, they talk to her and decide that she stays. The next day they tell her before leaving that she be careful with the queen that she can disguise herself as any object or person. Snow White is left alone; the queen prepares something evil and decides to go looking for her disguised as an old woman, she goes and meets her and gives her the poisoned apple, Snow White falls asleep, the dwarfs arrive and follow her until she falls off the cliff and dies, Snow White is put in a coffin and is adored by the dwarfs until her prince charming comes and wakes her up with a kiss, and they live happily ever after.

Conclusion: A spectacular movie from start to finish, I really don't get bored of watching it, and how can I not forget the dwarfs who give the film a bit of humor, every time I saw the dwarfs I felt like I was transported to cartoons like Looney Tunes or Tom and Jerry, it has a little bit of everything. The queen as a spectacular villain despite the fact that she appears in few scenes, she still receives praise as a villain.

tt0029583,rw10194276,alanarellano-06391,"Seven Dwarfs, One Masterpiece","One of Walt Disney's most cherished classics, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), is a revolutionary accomplishment in the history of animation. It established Disney as a leader in family entertainment and, as the first full-length animated picture, set a new benchmark for narrative, animation, and musical composition.

The story focuses on Snow White, a kind-hearted and innocent princess who is on the run from the Queen, her cruel stepmother, who is obsessed with being the ""fairest of them all."" The seven dwarfs-Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey-give heart, comedy, and special moments to Snow White as she seeks refuge with them. The poisoned apple scene and the transformation of the Queen into a hag are among those moments that are still remembered in animation history.

But the animation is the very standout feature of this film. The movement is fairly naturalistic for the characters, and the handwork is complex in detail for being at that age, something new even then. Technicolor managed to make a spectacular experience by bringing vibrant colors. This is all augmented emotionally with the musical score, consisting of classic tunes like ""Heigh-Ho"" and ""Someday My Prince Will Come."" The themes of the film-no less than its technical accomplishments-relate to love, compassion, and jealousy. Snow White's hope is the story's centerpiece, while companionship and loyalty are in store with the dwarfs to provide emotional support.

Undeniably, some of the latter's gender roles are old-fashioned compared to today's times. With Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, an indication was given that animation could also be a form of a cinematic experience that introduced subsequent animated movies.

With dozens of books on fairy tales, art and architecture, he travelled back across the pond and set to work inspired.

Ten years later, however, uniformed gum-chewers set off to rid Europe of art treasures, jewellery, valuables and precious metals. Oh no, that was fascism.

As for the movie itself, the acting is horrid from Zegler and Gadot, the story is confusing, vapid, and meaningless. The movie is about an hour and a half, but feels longer than Oppenheimer.
If you loved the original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, you'll hate this movie. Because it is far from the original Disney magic of long past.",1.0,2025-03-21,102,22,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

tt6208148,rw10412175,imdbfan-2360311063,"If i were given a choice to either watch Snow White or Madam Web, I would watch none.","Disney's Snow White (2025) is an absolute trainwreck of a film, a soulless, pandering mess that takes everything magical about the original and grinds it into a pile of corporate-approved sludge. From the moment the film starts, it's clear that no one involved actually cared about the heart of the story-instead, we're subjected to a joyless, preachy rehash that feels like it was assembled by a boardroom of executives desperate to check off every modern talking point rather than tell a compelling fairy tale. Rachel Zegler's Snow White is a complete misfire, a character so stripped of her original warmth and kindness that she might as well be an entirely different person. Gone is the gentle, hopeful princess who charmed animals and won over the dwarfs with her sincerity; in her place is a smirking, self-righteous bore who delivers cringeworthy one-liners and spends more time lecturing the audience than embodying any real fairy-tale spirit. Zegler's performance lacks any trace of the wide-eyed wonder that made Snow White iconic-instead, she comes across as disinterested, almost annoyed to be in the role, and her singing, while technically fine, feels autotuned and devoid of emotion, as if even the music was an afterthought in this hollow production. Gal Gadot's Evil Queen is another colossal disappointment, a villain who should have been a scene-stealing force of malice but instead stumbles through the film with all the intimidation of a disgruntled influencer. Gadot looks the part, sure, but her delivery is wooden, her menace nonexistent, and her attempts at dramatic flair fall completely flat. The famous ""Mirror, Mirror"" scene, once a chilling highlight of the original, is reduced to a lifeless exchange with zero tension, thanks to terrible pacing and a script that seems determined to undermine any sense of stakes. The Queen's backstory, a half-baked attempt at forced sympathy, only makes her less compelling, robbing her of the pure, delicious wickedness that made her such a memorable antagonist. Then there are the dwarfs-or rather, the bizarre, identity-less creatures Disney has replaced them with in a transparent attempt to dodge controversy. Stripped of their distinct personalities, they're reduced to a bland, interchangeable group of CGI-enhanced nobodies who contribute nothing to the story. There's no Grumpy, no Dopey, no Sleepy-just a handful of forgettable sidekicks who exist solely to nod along to Snow White's uninspiring monologues. The decision to sideline them in favor of this watered-down, politically safe alternative is cowardly, and worse, it's boring, sucking out yet another layer of charm from what should have been a lively, whimsical adventure. Even the Prince, already a thinly written character in the original, is somehow made even more irrelevant, appearing only long enough to remind us that Disney had no idea what to do with him. The romance, if you can even call it that, is completely lifeless, with zero chemistry between the leads and a rushed, unconvincing ""connection"" that feels like it was added out of obligation rather than any genuine storytelling need. The film's visuals are just as uninspired, with cheap-looking CGI backdrops and a color palette so dull it feels like the movie was shot through a layer of grime. The enchanted forest, once a place of wonder, now resembles a low-budget video game cutscene, and the animals-previously a delightful part of Snow White's world-move with all the natural grace of glitchy robots. The musical numbers, supposedly one of Disney's biggest strengths, are shockingly forgettable, with new songs that evaporate from memory the second they end and reworked classics that lack any of the original's spark. The humor, what little there is, lands with a thud, relying on painfully forced modern quips that clash horribly with the fairy-tale setting. Every creative decision in this film feels calculated, focus-grouped, and utterly devoid of passion, as if the entire production was engineered to avoid offending anyone rather than to entertain. The result is a movie that pleases no one-too sanitized to satisfy fans of the original, too bland to win over new audiences, and too afraid of its own legacy to take any real risks. It's a film that exists solely because Disney knows the name ""Snow White"" will sell tickets, no matter how little effort they put into it. By the time the limp, anticlimactic finale rolls around, the only emotion it inspires is relief that it's finally over. This isn't just a bad remake-it's a depressing testament to how far Disney has fallen, trading timeless storytelling for hollow, market-tested mediocrity. If this is the future of their live-action adaptations, then maybe it's time they just stopped making them altogether.",1.0,2025-03-28,85,16,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

One of those films was ""Snow white and the seven dwarfs."" one of the earliest animated films based upon an old fairy tale. But i've said it before and i'll say it again. the modern day Disney would never approve of this film. Why? Cause it's way too scary! We begin with the evil Queen. She doesn't really have a name, just the Evil queen. she owns a magic mirror, whom she asks ""Who's the fairest one of all?"" and that mirror is supposed to say ""you, fair queen."" but one day it decides to mention Snow white's name. This forces Snow White to run away.
The fairy tale of snow white strikes a chord in everybody's heart, and the film itself is epic, even by today's standards.
However, I think it's one of the scariest children's films of all time, and if the Walt Disney company ever made another film like this today, All the soccer moms and high school musical crybabies and fanboys would call for it's boycotting.

tt0029583,rw0017070,GuyCC,"As Pure A Film As Its Namesake (Minus the ""Seven Dwarfs"" Part).","Since the 1930's, Disney animated films have been a strange collection. Some are made to present new ideas in story and animation and push the limits of the genre of animated film.  Others have been purely formulatic and meant as little more than money makers.  But overall, there have been more hits than misses (at least with their feature film animation).  Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs really did push the revolution.
A few years shy of 70, the film still holds up really well, especially with the remastered print and even moreso on DVD.  It's the other animated character (besides a certain mouse) that built the house of Disney, and it's obvious as to why when seen.  It's a beautiful film, with great animation, a simple story and at the risk of sounding like a press release, truly unforgettable songs and characters.  It's a part of American film history, up there with ""Casablanca"" and ""Citizen Kane"", and even the more modern classics like ""Star Wars"" and ""Indiana Jones"".  It's aged well, and it shows why sometimes simplicity is truly the way to go in terms of presenting a story.  It has a straightforward manner with plenty of visual marvels, especially when you sit back and realize how long this film has been around, and how even some animation of today still can't compare.
The DVD itself is filled with more background information than a person can watch in one sitting.  It really makes up for the initial discs released by Disney DVD, and bodes well for later classics such as ""Aladdin"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Lion King"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"" (Can you tell which ones I'm waiting for?).

tt0029583,rw9443843,simonabiancaa,Your original fairytale,"My whole childhood consisted of Walt Disney productions and I've always felt they truly contributed to making me a better person, so I wanted to rewatch them now, as an adult, as a personal project and to see how I view them with my grown-up eyes. I know that there has been quite a fuss upon the Disney old movies in terms of political correctness, body appreciation, beauty standards and all that, but my old soul has always chosen to see beyond that (even when I didn't have the filters I have nowadays).
While there are a lot of things that have ""improved"" as the years passed by and technology evolved, my heart still melts eveytime I see scenes from these movies. I believe the nostalgia, along with the purity sense that this movie comes with, really have a lot to teach us. As a kid, I truly believe your untouched eyes and visions only see the good and the beauty (or so I tend to believe) and this kind of movies teaches us the first, most basic and beautiful lessons: to be good, graceful, considerate, to accept others and to love them as they are (of course, exceptional cases not included here), to be in harmony with nature, with other creatures, with yourself, to not harm others, to help them, to do good and be good. Why this urge to ""teach"" children and show them the raw, real world when they are at such little age? Why this hatred on these ""fairytales"" that do not prepare children for the harsh experiences that will face? It's childhood and it's the time we're at our purest for a reason. I grew up watching these movies and reading the stories behind them, as well as other fairytales and ""good wins over evil"" stories and I don't feel like I've been fooled in any way. On the contrary, I truly believe my empathic sense that I have had since childhool was mostly due to the understanding these movies taught me to have over others. And to look up at role models, not in terms of beauty or ""woman's role"" (because I am a young woman), but in terms of what a good heart can do and how it impacts others.

tt0029583,rw3115848,AntonFokker,And then there was Disney.,"It is not an surprise that I think that Snow White is one of the greatest and most important movies in history. It is the start of the medium animation, and the first of an almost continuous line of fantastic movies by Walt Disney. Does this film still hold up after almost 80 years? Of course it does.
Let us begin with the animation. Even after 77 years, it still is one of the best examples of Disney animation at it's best. It is flu- wend, colorful and the use of Walt's multi plane camera (a device that created the illusion of depth) is fantastic.
Because this is Walt's first feature animated movie, they use a simple story. I won't tell the plot in this review, because you all have seen this film so it is pointless to tell something that you all already know. There is no point explaining the plot because this is the kind of film in which everything else is more important than the plot.
And now the characters. To be honest, Snow White is not the greatest character in this film, even Walt Disney him self sad that she is basically an plot device. I do not say that she is a bad character. she is good, but the only other complain I have with her is that her voice is ridiculously high. I have heard Adriana Caselotti in the Wizard of Oz and there she sounds normal. And now the thing everyone remembers of this movie: The dwarfs. Thy are some of the best characters ever created in any movie. The evil queen is also great, especially when she is turned into the witch.
All the songs are great and fantastic. My favorites are: High Ho, the washing song, the silly song and some day my prince will come. For some reason Disney didn't own the rights of the songs ever since 1937, because it didn't have his own music department yet.
It still is one of the greatest Disney movies ever, and one of the greatest movies ever. To the one or two people who didn't saw the movie: Go to the store and buy it!!! it is an must own for everyone.",10.0,2014-11-02,3,1,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

tt0029583,rw5836199,sublimineyes,"Disney animation from the age before they became dull, predictable and saccharine","I watched this very soon after watching what was considered one of their 80s high points (though largely now forgotten), The Great Mouse Detective. I've also been forced to watch recent Disney fare like Frozen in recent times and can remember my feeling about them. It is years since I've watched Snow White.
What a difference!
This is an actual, proper attempt at a meaningful film, not some marketing or pandering exercise with paper thin intent, tiresome & predictable design & characters, and an OD of sugar or saccharine. Very refreshing.
It feels far more like the masterpieces of animation that are still possible in Japan and were possible with Pixar but which Disney's shallowness has made impossible from them in decades.
The quality of animation of figures has a naturalistic movement that is simply so far ahead of current Disney it isn't funny. And the backgrounds. Even with modern day computing power recent stuff is weak, while the second half of the 20th century stuff is just plain cheap and childish in comparison.
There is also actual atmosphere. The noirish shadows, the angles, there is genuine foreboding.
Pus it thankfully, so very thankfully, doesn't suffer from the pregnant pause face shots and poses that plague ends of scenes of so many of today's productions, animated or live action. If anything the transitions move a couple of seconds too quickly. But I'd still far rather have this older style of film making than the soapish current vogue.
The music is also wonderful. I don't know whether they work because I've heard them all my life or because they are actually good. But they do.
So, after all that, why not a 10? For 2 reasons.
1) Snow White herself. She is so matronising and privileged. Not a pleasant characterisation. The singing voice is also rather twee.
2) The denouement simply isn't believable.
If this film was made today like this I'd probably mark it 8, but given when it was made it deserves more, so a 9.

Act 2 - 5.1

Act 3 - 6.4

First Disney feature film

The Queen is obsessed with being the most beautiful person in the kingdom but the princess Snow White is more beautiful says the Magic Mirror

Snow White is kept suppressed as a maid to hide her beauty and meets the prince at the beginning of the film

Queen orders her huntsman to kill Snow White in the woods and to bring back her heart as proof

The huntsman can't kill Snow White and tells her to run as the queen wants her dead

Snow White ends up deep in the woods and sings with the animals and becomes friends with them

The animals lead her to a cottage in the woods and nobody is home so she cleans the home with the animals

Cut to the seven dwarfs working in the mine

They arrive home to their cottage and after some dumb misunderstandings they realize Snow White is sleeping in their beds

They get aquatinted with the princess and she tells them about her situation

Snow White says if they let her stay she will tend to the house and cook for them and they agree

Snow White starts to make the dwarfs more civilized and they have a very dated of view of woman with some comments from Grumpy especially, understandable as this took place in the 30's

Grumpy is the only one who doesn't want to accept these changes and he's incredibly annoying

The Queen asks the Mirror who the fairest of them all is and he still says Snow White is as she is living with the Dwarfs in the woods

The Queen makes and drinks a magic potion to disguise herself as an old hag and plans to give Snow White and apple that will enact a sleeping death

There's a lot of pointless filler scenes with the Dwarfs that don't add much to the film

Snow White tells the Dwarfs about Prince Charming in song who she met for like 2 minutes at the beginning of the film and sings of her dreams

The only antidote for the apples curse is loves first kiss which the Queen isn't worried about with the Dwarfs

The Dwarfs warn Snow White of the Queens evil powers as they leave to go to the mines and Grumpy has warmed up to her as well

The Queen arrives to the cottage and the animals try to warn Snow White but fail and go to tell the Dwarfs

The Queen tells Snow White that the apple is a wishing apple and all her dreams will come true if she takes a bite and the Dwarfs run home

Snow White wishes for a Prince to come and take her away to his castle and she takes a bite and collapses

The Dwarfs chase after the Queen in a devilish storm and she falls off a cliff to her death

Really like the foreshadowing with the vultures and instead of showing her death we see the vultures glad down to where she has fallen, probably the best scene sin the film

The Dwarfs and the animals mourn over Snow White and couldn't get up the nerve to bury her so they encased her in a glass coffin

The Prince hears of the princess in the glass coffin and goes and kisses her which is real weird because she is dead

The kiss awakens Snow White and the animals and the Dwarfs celebrate as the Prince carries her away

She rides off with the Prince and says goodbye to the Dwarfs and we see a castle in the distance presuming that Snow White does get everything that she ever wanted

Pretty generic and quick resolution for Snow White

The Queens jealousy and vanity is her death which is a bit off because Snow White gets everything that she has ever wanted just for being beautiful so there is a mixed message there

tt0029583,rw10411537,gnperuti,The one that started it all,"Words can never even begin to describe what a colossal landmark of a movie this is. For a film that everyone said would ruin Walt, it pretty much reshaped Hollywood in a way that few films can claim. Looking back on it years later, it's still a monumental achievement that mostly holds up exceptionally well. The story might not make a lick of sense if you think too hard on it, but that means nothing compared to the sheer, raw emotion it leaves you with, taking you on a journey that just leaves you more than satisfied by the end. And while there is a lot of focus on the comic antics surrounding the Dwarfs and the animals, which can feel distracting from the main plot, it's really easy to overlook and forgive that, since it gets plenty of laughs.
Admittedly, Snow White isn't as interesting as some of the later Disney Princesses; she's mainly just really nice. Thankfully, her niceness never gets to the point of annoying. Plus, she's still really likeable, charming, and at times, even kind of cute in how innocent she is. The Queen on the other hand, is absolutely frightening. Just how relentless she is in targeting our main character simply because she's prettier is enough to give you chills. Plus, her design as the old woman is beyond creepy. And the Dwarfs are easily the best characters in the film, both as individuals and as a group. They have endless personality and plenty of chemistry with each other and our heroine; plus, they more than carry the comedy they're given. The only dud among the cast is the Prince, who's such a non-entity that he might as well not be in the film. The animals have more personality than him, and they don't even talk.
For a film that will be 88 this year, it is amazing how well the animation has held up. This is classic hand drawn animation at its purest and most delightful. Everything is full of rich detail and color. When it needs to be pleasant, funny, or scary, it delivers ten fold. The character designs all look great too, especially the different looks of the Dwarfs, and the designs of the Queen's two forms. The score is full of classic songs that are instantly recognizable and a ton of fun to sing along to, as well as hum after. My personal favorite is, of course, the perennial classic Heigh Ho. The orchestral soundtrack is amazing, too.
Overall, there's a reason Snow White was such a massive game changer, and boy does it show. It isn't as good as many of the films that came later, but you have to start somewhere, and they definitely started on one heck of a high note. As for the recent remake, I'm staying far away from that abomination and sticking to the good version.",9.0,2025-03-28,10,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt6208148,rw10398637,imdbfan-8736843399,Snow White (2025),"It's good but should be inspired from Snow White not official Snow White.
""Disappointed"" is my word for this movie feels inadequate when describing my reaction to this film. Marketed as a fresh take, ""inspired by"" the classic tale, it quickly revealed itself to be a disappointingly truncated and seemingly rushed rendition of Disney's Snow White. The initial excitement of seeing a familiar story reimagined was swiftly replaced by a sense of melancholic recognition, a realization that this was less a creative inspiration and more a hollow echo of the original. This isn't to say the film was devoid of merit; certain visual elements were striking, and a few performances held promise. However, the overall experience was marred by a pervasive sense of missed opportunity.
The most glaring flaw was the film's jarring pacing. It felt as though crucial scenes were excised, leaving gaping holes in the narrative. Character development, a cornerstone of any compelling story, was sacrificed at the altar of brevity. Moments that should have resonated emotionally fell flat, due to the lack of necessary context and build-up. The relationship between the protagonist and their companions, intended to be a source of warmth and camaraderie, felt superficial and underdeveloped. Similarly, the antagonist's motivations, which could have been explored with nuance and depth, were reduced to a caricature of villainy. The film's insistence on adhering to the basic plot points of the original, while simultaneously rushing through them, resulted in a disjointed and unsatisfying experience.
This sense of incompleteness was particularly disheartening considering the rich potential of the Snow White story. The themes of innocence, envy, and transformation are timeless, offering ample room for creative exploration. Yet, this film seemed content to merely skim the surface, failing to delve into the psychological complexities of its characters or the symbolic depth of its narrative. The ""inspired by"" label felt like a deceptive marketing ploy, a way to lure in audiences with the promise of something new, only to deliver a diluted and rushed imitation of a beloved classic.
Would I recommend this film to my friends? Absolutely not. The one-hour runtime, while seemingly efficient, felt like a disservice to the source material. It was a wasted hour, an hour that could have been spent engaging with a film that truly understood the essence of Snow White. Compared to the masterful adaptations of Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin-films that managed to both honor their origins and forge their own distinct identities-this film felt like a pale imitation. Those films understood that taking the original, and adding to it, and making it their own, is the key to a successful movie. This Snow White inspired film, however, falls short. It lacked the heart, the depth, and the creative spark necessary to truly capture the magic of the original tale, leaving a lingering sense of disappointment and a yearning for a more inspired and fulfilling cinematic experience.",1.0,2025-03-24,96,19,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

Disney's latest live-action Snow White is a complete disaster, failing on nearly every level. From its uninspired lead actress to its soulless CGI, the film is a far cry from the timeless charm of the original. Worse still, its rewritten dialogues strip away the warmth and values that made the classic story beloved, replacing them with a hollow, antisocial message that alienates its audience.
Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White is one of the film's biggest weaknesses. She lacks the grace, innocence, and charm that made the original character so endearing. Instead of portraying a kind and humble princess, her version feels smug and detached, making it impossible to root for her. Her line delivery is often flat or overly self-assured, further distancing her from audiences expecting a sincere, heartfelt performance.
Visually, the film is just as unconvincing. The CGI-heavy effects strip the movie of any sense of realism or magic. The so-called ""dwarfs"" look like a lazy, computer-generated afterthought, draining the film of any personality. The artificial landscapes and overprocessed lighting make every scene feel plastic and soulless, turning what should be a visually rich fairytale into something that resembles a cheap video game cutscene.
Perhaps the most frustrating part is the film's complete disregard for the themes that made Snow White a beloved story in the first place. The rewritten dialogues turn what was once a tale of kindness, resilience, and family into an awkward, disjointed narrative that pushes an individualistic and almost antagonistic attitude toward traditional values. The result is a film that doesn't just fail to connect with the audience-it actively pushes them away.
In the end, Snow White is nothing more than a misguided, joyless attempt at modernizing a classic. Instead of honoring the legacy of the original, it distorts it beyond recognition, leaving audiences with nothing but disappointment.",1.0,2025-03-26,84,16,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

tt0029583,rw9564167,glenaobrien,On the ground floor of modern animation,"Watching this film you're aware that you're in on the ground floor of modern animation. The first cel-animated feature length film, Walt Disney's team of artists and technicians took an old European fairy tale and delighted audience with groundbreaking state of the art animation techniques that set the storytelling template for the century to follow. One might liken it to the pioneering digital work Pixar achieved in Toy Story in 1995 though, of course, they were building on Disney's foundations.
Disney himself was an autocrat and a bully who exploited his workforce. He was the epitome of the American venture capitalist whose Disney empire was always as much about making money as spinning dreams. Adriana Caselotti who voiced the lead role was forced to sign an agreement that she would never work again because Disney wanted to own everything about the Snow White character. Apart from a few very small voice parts and TV appearances she never really had much of a career.
Of course the story is a patriarchal stereotype that privileges female physical beauty as the highest value and reinforces the idea that every girl awaits the day when her prince will come and give her new life with his kiss. This reflects 1930s values but goes back much further to the source material in the Brothers Grimm. There's a sweet innocence in the adoration of the seven dwarves toward Snow White and in the touching maternal theme in her care of them.
I would think the wicked queen/witch sequences would be quite scary for small children, though my four-year-old grandson coped with it and enjoyed the film, especially the sequence where the seven dwarves washed up in the water trough. The songs are good and the overall entertainment value of Disney's first feature film holds up perfectly well. There's a direct line from Snow White to the Disney empire's ownership of the Star Wars and Marvel universes but in 1937, this was a huge risk, ridiculed as 'Disney's folly'. The subsequent academy awards and box office records it set upon its release as well as its current secure place in the canon of American mythology represent vindication for Walt Disney and his creative legacy.",10.0,2024-01-15,3,1,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt0029583,rw1423238,phillindholm,STILL The Fairest One Of All!,"There isn't much that hasn't already been said about ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", Walt Disney's first feature length animated film. Suffice it to say that it not only fulfilled the studio's hopes beyond their wildest dreams, it made possible the Disney films that followed it. From the famous Grimm fairy tale about a beautiful princess who flees her jealous stepmother and finds refuge with seven friendly dwarfs, Walt Disney created a cinematic milestone. At the time the film was in production until the day it was released, rival producers were supposedly referring to it as ""Disney's Folly"".Although this myth has been recently debunked in film historian JB. Kaufman's magnificent new book (''The Fairest One Of All:The Making Of Walt Disney's Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs''Weldon Owen/Disney Press, 2012)it's true that only after it's huge success, did fellow movie makers attempt their own full-length cartoon features. Upon it's debut, at Hollywood's Carthay Circle theater, (December 21, 1937)the film was embraced both by critics and audiences, grossing many times it's then record (for an animated film) $1.5 million budget. Eight successful reissues have kept the movie in the public consciousness now for over six decades, during which time the field of animation has grown by leaps and bounds. Still. despite the cinematic advances and the passage of time, ""Snow White"" stands alone. While the classic story is but a framework for the film (a fact which troubled me for years), ""Snow White"" can be fully enjoyed for the pioneer it truly is.
Along with a splendid cast of voices headed by Adriana Caselotti (Snow White) Harry Stockwell (father of Guy and Dean, as the Prince) and Lucille La Verne (The Queen), there are songs which can truly be called timeless: ""Whistle While You Work"", ""Heigh Ho"", ""Some Day My Prince Will Come"", etc.). Much time and effort went toward developing the characters of the Seven Dwarfs and giving each a distinct personality (absent in the original story) which went a long way in making audiences care for Snow White's plight. Interestingly enough, although the fairy tale was toned down considerably to make it more ""family friendly"", the overzealous way in which the film makers transformed the Wicked Queen into a hideous hag at the climax was the subject of an incredible amount of controversy at the time. In fact, it was under a partial ban in England which made it off-limits to children under 16 years of age! Nevertheless, it was the recipient of a special Academy Award in 1938.
To go on about the impact made by the film would be redundant. It simply must be seen to be appreciated. In 2001, it was released on DVD as the first of Disney's ""Platinum Editions"". And many months before it was in stores, there was great speculation about the content. All the anticipation was justified when the DVD finally arrived. Critics and consumers were overwhelmed (just like the audiences back in 1937) with both the content and the painstaking restoration (beyond that done for it's 50th anniversary reissue) and made it THE DVD for the subsequent holiday season. Without going into detail, it looks as if it were made yesterday, and sounds better than a film of this vintage could ever be expected to. But the streamlining has not diminished it's charm--only accentuated it. And when you think (before you are drawn into the story, and you ARE) that ""Snow White"", unlike today's computer-drawn animated features was entirely done by hand, that makes it even more of a miracle.In one scene, when Snow White is scrubbing the steps of the Castle, and pours water from a bucket on them, the effect is remarkable-and that one, near the beginning, is just one small sample of the film's artistry.Back to the DVD. Instead of listing the already well publicized bonus features, let me say that this ""Platinum Edition"" is like a self-contained history of the film, with hours worth of delights the most astounding being a pieced-together commentary by Walt Disney himself. Out of print for years, it is well worth the effort and expense to find. And although Disney made it a point to announce that they planned to go even further with their subsequent ""Platinum Editions"", they have yet to top this one. And I doubt they ever will. Incidentally, this year marks the film's 75th anniversary, and I can think of no better way to celebrate this movie milestone than picking up Professor Kaufman's beautiful new books The second volume '' Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs:The Art And Creation Of Walt Disney's Classic Animated film''is also published by Weldon Owen/Disney Press.It's a very extensive and fully detailed catalog of the ''Snow White'' exhibition,(currently at the Walt Disney museum in San Francisco,California).Here, the emphasis is more on the beautiful art as well as rough sketches and background paintings. Along with it's companion book ''The Fairest One Of All'' it will educate and enchant anyone who cares about the history of Film, Disney Animation and especially ''Snow White'' They are, without a doubt,the definitive tributes to a Timeless Classic, and together, they make perfect souveniers for both the film's 75th Anniversary and and a once in a lifetime event.",10.0,2006-07-18,133,12,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

A couple of little less negative things are that the first part of the movie is almost watchable. Mainly because it is decently true to the original. Zegler is not as bad as I thought, she can actually sing. And... uh... well, that is pretty much it.
Ignoring the Dwarfs for sanity reasons: Around the 30min mark or so this movie takes a very weird turn. Suddenly we are introduced to a bunch of characters (not the Dwarfs...) that will forever go down in history as the worst ever portrait on film. And from meeting those empty shells of characters it is all downhill.
Although Zegler is surprisingly not completely awful for most of the film, the rest of the cast are all so bad they make The Acolyte acting look masterful in comparison. The prince, whom is not a prince at all, just a robber and thief, he kisses snow like she has the plague, and Gadot is just Gadot trying to be... I dunno, some parody of an evil queen I guess.
This is about 50% true to the original, but the things they changed are so out there and so hilariously unpleasant I could not contain my laughter.

I give this a 2/10 because the first 20min was almost okay and because Zegler was not as horrible as I thought she would be. But make no mistake, this is one of the worst movies you will ever see.

tt6208148,rw10410538,lijppie,Snow White and the Seven Catastrophes,"Once upon a time, in a land where Hollywood still understood storytelling, Snow White was a beloved fairy tale about beauty, magic, and the perils of vanity. Fast forward to today, and we now have this-a cinematic train wreck that takes a pickaxe to nostalgia and buries it in an unmarked grave.
Let's start with the most baffling issue: the Evil Queen is more beautiful than Snow White. That's not just a nitpick; it obliterates the entire premise. Why is she jealous? Does she have self-esteem issues? Did her magic mirror get hacked? Watching this film, you'd think the real villain is common sense itself.
Then there's the protagonist. Now, I don't care who plays Snow White, but at the very least, make the story make sense. The original description-skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, hair as black as ebony-isn't just some throwaway line; it's the reason the story exists. Ignoring that detail makes it feel like the writers skimmed the Wikipedia summary and said, ""Eh, close enough."" Spoiler: It wasn't.
The film is also hilariously devoid of charm. No whimsy, no heart, just a dull, self-important slog that takes itself way too seriously while simultaneously treating the source material like garbage. It's like watching a birthday clown perform Shakespeare-awkward, painful, and fundamentally wrong.
The only joy I got from this experience was the memes mocking it, which ironically had more creativity than the entire film. If you want to enjoy Snow White, do yourself a favor: stick to the animated classic or, better yet, just stare at a blank wall for two hours. You'll get the same amount of plot development, but at least you won't leave feeling personally attacked.",,2025-03-27,8,5,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0
tt0029583,rw3022176,rbn_lrk-1,Why do we love Disney?,"I just watched Adamthewoo on Youtube doing another 24 hours Disneyland California.

One of the many famous rides are of course Snow White in the forest.

It all started in 1937 with a movie about a pretty Young girl Snow White banished from her Castle by a witch that reveals herself later on.

The girl meets seven dwarfs in the forest after getting lost at night.

In the meanwhile the witch tries to get rid of Snow White.

But, the movie ends of course happy ever after.

There are something for the Whole Family here.

Light and happy songs, an evil witch, retro animation from a forgotten time and more.

It gets very sweet, but there are some very dark parts too.

If you are very Lucky you might find the movie and the comic based on the movie in a shop somewhere.

Or even better maybe try your luck to find a Cinema showing.

Stays true to the original but adds new elements to it. Gal Gadot and Rachel Ziegler may have had bad tension off camera, but it didn't come through on camera.
Now I'm not saying this movie is great, the problems are with musical numbers, they just don't become something you want to sing too.

tt0029583,rw1320797,Spondonman,"""Wanna know a secret?""","It's spellbinding! I've just watched Snow White for the umpteenth time, and decided it's still as wondrous and lustrous as ever. The music, humour, and animation are stuck magically in the 1930's but it all seems as timeless as the story itself. The best place to see it is in a cinema of course, the same as my daughter and I did over and over again before Disney released it on video in '94.
All available positive epithets (magnificent, amazing, stupendous etc) apply to this one, nearly a 10 in my book. For good or bad SW will never be surpassed, because of capitalist pressures to ensure everything makes money: animation designed and drawn by human beings has lost out to the precise but soulless computer. Ditto music with tunes and marvellous lyrics played well. Gentle humour that the entire family can appreciate has given way to appreciation of smut and cynicism. And that's just Disney! My favourite bits: The song ""Wishing"", and looking up the well at SW; the dwarfs first seeing her SW in their beds asleep; the dwarfs' washing sequence and song. The only thing I never liked was the apparently rushed ending - the dwarfs are looking after SW's ""inanimate"" body through the seasons, this handsome guy comes along, kisses her and they both skedaddle into the massive sunset at warp speed! I think I wanted it to last another couple of hours.
Overall, to my feeble mind this is High Art! Highbrows probably don't like it because it was charming and incredibly popular, so does any normal person in the world dislike this film, and if so, why?",9.0,2006-03-20,52,11,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt0029583,rw1185939,ctrout,The Best Animated Film of All Time,"This is a simple story of friendship and courage brought beautifully to life by the master of animation, Walt Disney. It follows the story of a young girl who doesn't know that she's the fairest one of all. But the evil Queen does know this and will stop at nothing to rid the world of her beauty. Even if it means losing the Queen's own beauty.
The Queen sends someone to kill Snow White, but the man who has to fulfill the dirty deed cannot go through with it and sets Snow White free into the forest. She stumbles upon a vacant cottage in the heart of the wilderness. She naps there and is awakened by what she describes as little men.
These men learn to love Snow White as a friend and they live together in peace until the Queen learns that the beautiful girl is still alive and must destroy Snow White herself.
Even today that storyline is a little complex for most children. Yet everyone who sees it seems to love it and cherish it in their heart. It was the first of its kind and who knew that it would also end up being the best? This put Disney on the map as a major studio and also paved the way for the animated feature film.
It's definitely something you can't pass up and something you must show to your own children while they are young. I know they'll enjoy it as much as we all did when we were younger and I know they'll keep a special place in their heart for it because it's not only the best animated film, but also one of the best movies of all time.",10.0,2005-10-03,4,2,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

Gal Gadot is a goddess in every sense a beautiful woman, who should have no issues getting jealous of another woman's looks.
Rachel Zegler is just average, not someone I'd crawl over broken glass with my flies open to try and bag a kiss from.
Here the fundamental flaws in the films logic are laid bare, Rachel can sing .. but that's about it.
The film after its disastrous reshoots which meant it was delayed for over a year, it manages to shoehorn in some horrendous cgi dwarves along with bandits ???. Bandits ????, now forgive me but I do not recall these being in the original. It's pretty evident that these were the original magical beings or poor substitutes for the dwarves and the film couldn't structurally exist without them due to the footage that had already been filmed.
The film follows certain beats from the original initially before deciding it wants to be something else, and the mediocre songs do not help either.
You also know there's a massive issue with the film when they've literally dropped the 'Seven Dwarfs' from the title and simply called it 'Snow White'. The holy grail of the Disney legacy is subsequently crucified in the name of a modern re-invention of the classic and believe me I am furious that Disney didn't have the respect for the original and hired an actress in the lead who has nothing but contempt for it. Rachel has made that clear from her big mouth in numerous press junkets where they let her open it.

Instead of celebrating the traditional elements that made Snow White beloved for generations, the filmmakers decided to completely alter the character dynamics in an attempt to be ""progressive."" Newsflash: changing the essence of characters just for the sake of social commentary does NOT equal good storytelling!
Snow White herself feels more like a caricature than a character. She's portrayed as a rebellious teenager, full of angst, and completely dismisses the charm that made her story enchanting. The whimsical love story is reduced to a tired trope of ""I don't need a prince,"" diminishing the emotional core of the original tale. It's like they set out to remove every ounce of magic in favor of some misguided notion of empowerment.
And let's talk about the dwarfs. They've been re-imagined in a way that's not only ridiculous but also insulting. Instead of being endearing side characters, they come off as a jumbled mess of stereotypes with zero development. Their jokes fall flat, and it's clear that the writers were more focused on pseudo humor than crafting an engaging narrative.
The plot twists are not only predictable but also devoid of any real stakes. By the time we got to the climax, I found myself rolling my eyes rather than feeling any tension or excitement.
And the ending? Don't even get me started! It's a slap in the face to anyone who cherishes the original story.
If you're looking for the magic and wonder that Snow White used to bring, you won't find it here. This adaptation has completely misunderstood the heart of the story.

It's a Technicolor masterpiece that should be enjoyed by children and adults alike. Although I must admit, some parts of the film are dated, notably the dialogue and the storytelling and the fact that Snow White is a stereotypical housewife. She cleans the house, cooks dinner, makes pies, and is not very bright. Nevertheless, she kicked off the Disney Princess trend as well as the animated film trend.

As with all Disney products, there is a lot of schmaltz explaining to themselves how great they are. In this case, I will have to agree with them. The platinum edition of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" makes it well worth trading in your old version or just retiring it. The two-disk edition has more information than can be absorbed in one sitting.
There are a lot of DVD's goodies or extras. I must mention a few. This takes advantage of your remote control for navigation. To help you decide you have the magic mirror as a guide through both disks and all the feature sections. The magic mirror reminds me of the morose robot in Douglas Adams' ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.""
The only negative comment I have is on the second disk as you navigate the menus do not highlight like they should and leave you guessing as to what you have selected until you press the OK button.
If I had looked at the features first, I would have found a game. ""Dopey's Wild Mine Ride"", which required me to go back to the feature, as I could not remember all the details it asked about. Some of the feature information is redundant. Some will require reading. One of the posters that were displayed looked like an advertisement for ""Campbell's Cream of Dwarfs Soup.""
There is a Barbra Streisand version of ""Some Day My Prince Will Come"" which was distracting (no offense Barbra) and would have been much better left sounding like Janet McDonald.
The printed Grimm's version of the Snow-White story was an eye-opener.

tt0029583,rw6109838,xiaoli7377,Revolutionary,"""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is one of the most important films of all time. As the first ever full-length animated feature, Walt Disney was continuously mocked by the press for risking the future of his studio on such an experimental project. Luckily for Walt, ""Snow White"" shines as a marvel of animation, and is still a heartfelt viewing experience over eighty years after its release.
Snow White (Adriana Caselotti) is a scullery maid and the step-daughter to the evil and vile Queen (Lucille La Verne). The Queen is told by her Magic Mirror (Moroni Olsen) that Snow White is ""the fairest of them all"", which prompts the Queen into getting a huntsman (Stuart Buchanan) to kill her. Snow White flees and finds solace in the home of seven dwarfs who mine gemstones.
It's a pretty simple story. The movie is only 83 minutes long, and much of that run time is merely music and dancing characters. While it lacks much substance, it is the style and beauty of the animation seamlessly blending with sound effects and music that make this little movie such a treat. The dwarfs and the forest animals are also cute and funny as more comedic characters. Particular favorites of mine are Dopey and the tortoise.
Overall this comes as an absolute recommendation for anyone who is in love with animated film and fairy tales.

Released in 1937, Walt Disney's ambitious adaptation of the Grimm Faerie Tale Snow White was met with skepticism from many, including Walt's brother Roy. With the exception of a aborted animated adaptation of Edgar Rice Burrough's John Carter novels at MGM, animation was mostly used for short subjects or featurettes, such as Disney's Silly Symphonies and Alice Comedies. Production was rife with obstacles to the point Disney ended up taking a second mortgage to cover the film's budget. Many Hollywood insiders at the time predicted the film would flop nicknaming the film ""Disney's Foley"", and upon it's release became the highest grossing sound film of all time until it was displaced by Gone with the Wind. All these years later, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarves still carries with it the same glorious animation and emotional resonance that helped redefine the capabilities of animation.
It's pretty pointless to critique the plot of something like Snow White (down to the fact Disney themselves seem to do it every other day) and much like the source material from the Brothers Grimm story, you can point out logical leaps, plot holes, or any number of things you can read ""too deeply"" into for the sake of a smug laugh (as the Shrek franchise has built itself upon). The reason the story in Snow White works is because it plays on an emotional level. Snow White representing goodness, kindness, and humility in the face of a queen who's cruel, vindictive, spiteful, and sadistic creates the right dynamic for this type of story to work and draw the audience in making them forget about the fact they are watching a movie let alone all the technical details that have gone into the animation.
The animation in Snow White is a gold standard for a reason, and a big reason for that is in how dynamic and versatile it is. The animation is beautiful, it's funny, it's intense, it's atmospheric, and covers pretty much all of the emotional spectrum getting all manner of reactions from audiences which helps create the needed audience investment. Every scene is rich in detail from the first frames with even scenes as seemingly minor as watching the Seven Dwarves sleeping filled with detail and vibrancy. While the dwarves are more rubbery and typical of animation standards, they serve as good points of balance against the more realistic looking woodland creatures or human characters that helps give the film a dynamic movement of all varieties. The animation on the Queen in particular is great because there are two versions of The Queen with a beautiful but very hardened starting model that oozes contempt and superiority, and a disguise model used later that works at bringing the ""true"" form of her character to light.
Snow White and the Seven Dwarves along with Wizard of Oz is not just an important film in history, but also an enjoyable and emotional experience that you can't help but get wrapped up in. While years of homage, parody, and nitpicking have etched their ways into our collective minds leading to of course Shrek and its many, many, many clones, even after nearly 90 years its still left an impression and it probably still will for years to come.",9.0,2021-08-15,1,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

Will it hold up? Is it as good as I remember it? Will the re-visitation tarnish the precious memory of this film that I have?
I am happy to report that, upon a fresh viewing of the first full length animated film every, that I can still declare SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS ""the fairest of them all"".
Made in 1937, by the visionary Walt Disney, this film defies the odds - many calling it ""Walt's Folly"". No one had attempted a full length animated film before and the skeptics were many, but what Walt knew is that he had all the standard elements of a good story - a heroine we can root for, an evil villain, some comic characters that can help us laugh (and cry) and, more importantly, he had the skillful craftsmen of the Walt Disney Studios that can pull off such a feat.
And...pull it off they did! This film is gorgeous and lush to look at. Upon this viewing, I was drawn to the background, and the edges of the frame, marveling at the detail that was interwoven into each, hand drawn imagery - giving this tapestry a lushness and thickness heretofore unseen on the screen.
As for the story of the film - and the film itself - Disney was smart enough to know that ""less is more"". The film is compact - running a relatively quick 83 minutes - this was a two-fold solution. (1) It helped move the film along at a sprightly pace, never once resting or losing energy and (2) this means that the artists only had to draw what was necessary for this streamlined story.
The music, of course, is wonderful and important part of this film. This was one of the first movie musicals, and was the first film to release a Soundtrack Album. From ""Some Day My Prince Will Come"" to ""I'm Wishing"" to ""Heigh-Ho"" and ""Whistle While You Work"", the songs moved the story forward and added depth to the characters portrayed on the screen.
If you haven't caught this film in awhile, I heartily recommend you check it out - it works for young and old alike. A good film to share with children of today, to show them what lush, hand drawn animation looks like. Come for the fun of the Dwarfs and the Villainy of the Evil Queen, stay for the richness of the tapestry and the attention to detail that a true classic film portrays.

tt0029583,rw3039622,The_Film_Cricket,What generosity.,"Before Snow White, animation was three minutes of motion as chickens sang, cows and dogs played instruments and all to tinny pre-school music. For this film, the animators under Walt Disney's supervision had to create an entirely new process, they had to create not just well-rounded characters but they had to reinvent an entirely new film method of language in order to design a film literally from scratch.

It wasn't enough to simply put together a cohesive story. The world inside Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is populated in every inch of the screen with supporting characters: rabbits, birds, turtles, deer, skunks, chipmunks, squirrels, mice, etc. They packed the frame so that everything is always in motion and we are never faced with any negative space. Where most films are interested in the two or four characters in the center, the animator's genius was to create a population, a full-rounded world that suggested that space existed just off camera. That, in our minds, creates an orientation of three-dimensional space onto a film that doesn't have any. Live action films always have space off-camera, but in animation, it doesn't exist.

The technological marvel was the multi-plane camera which allowed objects in the foreground and the background to move independently of one another and independently of the central action. It also allowed the objects in the frame to move at various speeds and various distances to create a three-dimensional feel. This was long before computers, when animation was a painstaking practice in which each cell was drawn and painted one-by-one by hand (production on this film actually began in 1934). On the multi-plane camera, pieces of the artwork were lain on various platters on the camera that moved independently of one another so the various cells could move opposite of one another. The result was that a house in the background could have objects moving independently in the foreground.

The animators had the talent to create a palette that was alive. Take, for example, Snow White's nightmare journey through the forest as the branches of the trees reach out and the eyes bear down upon her. It would be enough just to have a girl frightened by the forest but to see it through her eyes to visualize the nightmare is part of the extra step, the further burst of inspiration. It wasn't entirely necessary to give the trees eyes or to draw them in such detail that they have twisted, angry faces, but it adds a level of generosity to the visuals.

But the palette would be nothing without expressive characters to put in front of it. The seven dwarfs have faces that are expressive, with big eyes, wide mouths and soft-round bodies, much like a child. And with the details in character design, they were also infused with emotions. Take for example the scene in which the dwarfs mourn for Snow White, their teary faces hung down in true expression. It would be one thing if the dwarfs simply cried, but note how the light and shadow play across their sad faces. No two characters are alike, no two characters move alike. There's real sadness in that scene. The whole movie is like that. The Dwarfs are seen as individuals, and we can easily tell them apart by more than their names and corresponding tics. The same can be said for the wicked queen, whose face glows with stunning beauty and whose disguise, an old crone, is round and somewhat inviting (we can understand the trap that Snow White falls into).

Ironically, the least impressive characters are Snow White and Prince Charming. They look and act and movie with such realism that they aren't quite as interesting. How would Snow White have lasted in history if the Disney animators had given her more animated dimension, more to the tone of the dwarfs? And despite the title, the dwarfs and the evil Queen actually dominate the picture. They are so exaggerated that they have more room to play. The Queen too has exaggerated movements but only after she is transformed into the old crone.

What Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs offers is the full experience of what the canvas of an animated feature can do. It explores a storytelling medium that would be severely limited in a live-action movie and frees it up to expand imagination. Others have come along and others have done better, but Snow White came first and it's was a major step from what had come before. What genius. What generosity of the visuals. What imagination.",,2014-06-25,7,2,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

Where would the animation world be without the humongous success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs? If the movie failed back in 1937, there would be no Disney Company today, no Lion King, and no Disneyland. Disney's Folly, as critics first called it, would probably have scared any other industry from attempting such an ambitious and innovative project. Pixar may not have ever had the chance to put out their groundbreaking features, and even the Disney- and fairy tale-bashing Shrek may never have been made if Snow White didn't set the course for the world of the animated feature.
There must have been tremendous pressure on everyone involved in the making of Snow White, but they did not disappoint. The end result includes a timeless story, classic songs, and beautiful imagery that will live on for future generations to enjoy. In fact, this was only the second movie that captured my nieces' full attention spans (The Lion King being the first).
As you can tell, for an animation and Disney fan like myself, Snow White is a perfect milestone in the movie world. Even compared to the animation and storytelling styles of today, Snow White still stands the test of time.

tt0029583,rw7117896,lanejody,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) - Movie Review (MINOR SPOILERS),"Dang, this movie made an impact. On the world. The fact that next to nobody believed in Walt when he was making this movie is astounding. Like, why would anybody want to watch a feature-length cartoon? That was common thought back in the day. But look where we are now. If this movie had been released in the present day, it would most likely receive bad critical and commercial reception. Its age is what makes it so special. If you compare it to movies today, you're going to notice a lot of outdated storytelling mechanics. Is that a bad thing? No. Definitely not. In my opinion, that's the most special thing about this movie. I can feel the age, but that makes me love it even more. It's timeless. You don't feel the age from outdated stereotypes or references, but from the physical aspects. There are a few things that wouldn't pass today - Snow White, although a good protagonist, isn't exactly a realistic 14-year-old girl. But back in 1937, that was Walt's full intention: he wanted her to be an example for young girls to follow. There are quite a few scenes that drag out quite a bit too long (notably a 5-minute sequence of the Dwarfs washing their hands), but that used to be the norm. They were experimenting with the art, playing around with these characters, building them up - and speaking of characters, the Dwarfs are hilarious. For a movie that came out in 1937, this is actually really funny, it took me by surprise. The Dwarfs are so charming in each of their personalities - my favorites would have to be Doc, Grumpy and Dopey - and they had some really good character development that, again, I wasn't expecting. And let's not forget, the animation carried this movie. I much prefer the grand artistry of the Golden Age over the more realistic style of animated movies nowadays. Just look at Walt's first cartoon, Steamboat Willie, and then look at this. Yeah. Every frame of each movie in this era might as well be a painting - it's just that good. Of course, this film isn't perfect - there are a few plot conveniences that we could've gone without. The villain is killed by a random lightning bolt instead of being overthrown by the protagonists. The Prince randomly stumbles into the forest and decides to kiss Snow White's dead body. It's okay, though. This is, of course, a landmark in film history. It might not be the best compared to movies today, but back in 1937, this was top of the line, one of the greatest things the world had ever seen, and it still holds up today. I love it more every time I watch it. If you don't enjoy it, that's okay, I can understand. But if you can't show the tiniest bit of respect, I don't know what to say.

Snow White is a cheerful and innocent girl who can talk to animals and convince them to do chores for her. Her stepmother hates her guts because she has a magical mirror that says Snow White is more attractive than her, so she puts a hit on her head. The guy who's supposed to make her sleep with the fishes can't do it and tells her to shove off and never return.
Well, she runs into the forest and meets 7 dwarves who work in the mines and the dwarves grow to appreciate having a feminine presence around the house.
This is a visual feast. Not only is it superbly animated, but most of the characters, particularly the dwarves, are very expressive (in fact most are named after their most salient characteristic).
Oddly the three main human characters' faces are ill-defined. Perhaps that was on purpose as they just represent archetypes? (Snow White representing ebullient feminine youth, the queen representing female jealous a la Hera, the prince just a deus ex machina). Nevertheless, it doesn't extend to every human. The scene with the hunter unable to deal the coup de grace is superbly dramatic and the queen's face comes alive with giddy wickedness as the old hag.
As for the backgrounds and settings, they're full of grand scenes you won't soon forget. The dungeon scene and the final confrontation on the cliff might just stay with you permanently.
The plot is pure fluff but this movie isn't about plot. It's about recapturing the wonder of traditional European fairy tales, which themselves are only rough outlines of the most primal of human archetypes and the barest of universal human scenarios.
It's a brick house. Built to last.
Honourable Mentions: Game of Thrones (2011). Peter Dinklage brings the character of Tyrion Lannister to life. Without a doubt the most serious and nuanced representation of a dwarf character I have seen in a work of fiction.",9.0,2021-11-04,1,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt0029583,rw3517612,filipemanuelneto,Iconic,"Based on a Grimm Brother's tale, this film tells the story of Snow White, a princess forced to hide from the hatred of her stepmother. Directed by David Hand and produced by Walt Disney, it has the participation of great voice actors. The soundtrack is a responsibility of Paul J. Smith, Frank Churchill and Leigh Harline. Nominated for an Oscar for Best Soundtrack, this film earned to Disney the honorary statuette the following year.
This film immediately won a place in history. Having been the first Walt Disney feature film, it was decisive for the evolution of what we know as animated film. Since the thirties, this movie has been in the lives of successive generations, despite having had few awards. In fact, its the definitive proof that awards don't immortalize a movie. Its ability to win public every year and persist in people's lives is, ultimately, the absolute consecration of a work of cinema.
The script is simple but extraordinarily effective, adapting (almost rewriting and polishing) Grimm Brother's story. Snow White is a pre- teen girl, very naive and pure, as it was considered correct at the time (current audiences prefer a less candid approach). The Queen is the incarnation of evil and the perfect antagonist. The prince is the representation of the honest and faithful man, who saves the girl. And of course, we have the famous Seven Dwarfs, supporting characters who serve as comic element and come directly to the hearts of children, with their defects or characteristics, a rather clumsy way and a huge sense of generosity.
The drawings are not as visually pleasing as will become in future films. Pencil lines are quite obvious and the colors are slightly alive. However, this technique was starting so that's something natural. The soundtrack is essential for any movie lover and contains one of the most famous songs from Disney films, ""Heigh Ho"", sung by the dwarfs when they return from their mine. The music perfectly accompanies the film and speak to the public with the same eloquence of the drawings.",8.0,2016-08-03,1,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

tt0029583,rw4980659,crosswalkx,The best movie with Snow White running away from her stepmother queen being a serial killer,"I have seen this movie and I liked how well it was made being the first Disney cartoon movie at the time.

Snow White is a teenage girl who lives with her abusive Stepmother the queen who's obsessed with killing Snow White just so she can have the rotten mask in the mirror tell her she's more beautiful than Snow White.

First of all I liked Snow White, she's kind to animals and people and 7 funny dwarves. She helped clean up the mess the dwarves made in their cottage house. She did become a homeless woman after the huntsman sent her running away from home.

I liked the 7 dwarves Doc, Bashful, Sleepy, Sneezy, Happy. But I liked Dopey the funny man and I liked Grumpy as I relate to him. The 7 dwarves were nice enough to provide Snow White shelter since she became homeless. I also liked the dance party and they fought the Evil Queen and won.

I did like the Huntsman as he stood up to the queen and spared Snow Whites life and tricked the Queen.

The Prince Charming character I didn't know much about as the Disney animators didn't give him enough screen time, I would've like to know more about his life. But thankfully he saved Snow White's life with a kiss and they both got hitched and possibly married in the castle.

I didn't like the Stepmother Queen at all as she was a serial killer and a murderer in her heart. She ended up growing old like a creepy old beggar woman and tried to kill her stepdaughter with a poisoned apple. Thankfully she came to her untimely death falling off a cliff.

I also didn't like the Magic Mirror masked man who deceived the queen and told her lies about her and Snow White her stepdaughter. I wish her stepmother would've broke the mirror and change her evil murderous ways.

Overall this is a fairy tale movie but there's some PG-13 content stuff involved in this movie. But it's a very good movie to watch and I highly recommend watching this movie, it is a slow movie but still worth watching.

For the rating of this movie I would rate it PG-13 for scary scenes, peril, brief violence.",9.0,2019-07-06,1,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

Like the cute flip book you would make on the corner of your notepad but better type stuff. WAY BETTER! The detail they achieve is remarkable. I know Snow White's face is weird (white people!) but the rest is stunning.

tt0029583,rw10055111,filmbuff-05706,Disney's First Film Is So Wonderful That Even Hitler Loved It.,"A long time ago, a man named Walt Disney entered Hollywood and made cartoon shorts with an animated rodent named Mickey Mouse. A few shorts later, he proposed an idea of making a feature length animated film. This was deemed ""Disney's Folly"", after all, who would want to sit through a 90-minute cartoon?
Walt proved the hecklers wrong, and he made one of the greatest movies ever made, which the American Film Insitute calls the #1 animated film of all time- Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. It's one of my Top 10 favorite Disney movies, and even Hitler considered it to be his favorite movie. When your movie can win the heart of a wicked dictator like Hitler, you've made something special.
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has a pretty simple story. Snow White is a princess, named after the color of her beautiful skin. Her evil stepmother becomes envious when her magic mirror tells her that Snow White is the most beautiful in the land, and she plots to kill Snow White to take that rank. For her safety, a huntsman warns her to hide, and she finds shelter at the cottage of 7 little men, who mine diamonds in the daytime.
Snow White is beautifully animated, using paints and still images combined to make consistent images- like a sheet for Snow White's hair, her head, her dress, etc. Considering that this is the first animated feature film, it's impressive to see all the detail put in, like the walls of roofs of buildings, and spiders crawling out of a dusty container that the Queen kicks.
The songs are nice as well- Heigh Ho being the catchiest, and I'm Wishing, The Dwarf's Yodeling Song, and Someday My Prince Will Come being other notable ones.
The cast works well too- Adriana Caselotti voices Snow White and her high pitch gives her a sweet personality. Sadly for her, she struggled to find work after this because her voice was too recognizable- any role she did, she would have been seen as ""Oh, that's Snow White"" not ""That's Adriana Caselotti."" (That said, she does say ""Wherefore art thou, Romeo?"" in The Wizard of Oz.)
Harry Stockwell has a strong voice singing as The Prince, and Lucille La Verne does an excellent job as The Queen, with her envy flowing through her vocal cords. She even offered to voice the Old Lady that she transforms into, and after a few failed tries, she excused herself and returned with the right voice. When asked how she did it, she simply responded ""Oh, I just took my teeth out."" The dwarf actors, deserve praise for their voice work as well- as do the other performers.
Like I said, this was deemed to be Disney's Folly, and it cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to make- causing Walt to be in debt with the bank. Luckily, those critics were proven wrong. The film was a huge financial success (with adjusted inflation, it is still the highest grossing animated movie of all time, and it's considered by many to be the greatest animated film ever made. And rightfully so.)
Think about it. What's your favorite animated movie? Mine is The Prince of Egypt, but my favorite Disney movie is Toy Story. Whether you love The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King, or whatever else, that movie exists because Walt didn't give up on his passion and gave us Snow White on December 21st, 1937.
And for that, we should all take a moment to thank Walt Disney. Because of his passion and hard work, we have one of the finest movies ever made, regardless of the fact that it is animated. Or- maybe because of it. In fact, even if another animated movie had never been made, it would be worth it, because it is a glorious piece of filmmaking.
There is talk of a remake of this movie in the works- with a Colombian-American playing the princess with skin as white as snow, where she is a feminist who makes the men clean the house and isn't saved by The Prince.
Such a film is not only unnecessary, but spits in the face of the legacy of Walt. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is not even about a servant turned princess- but one of a kind girl who finds her true love. And for Walt, it is a story of proving those who discourage you wrong and succeeding in your dreams.
Snow White and the Seven Dwrfs is what started Disney and I fear that the remake might be what ends it. I hope that those who have been making it consider this and end the production and leave Walt's masterwork alone.
This is simply one of the greatest movies ever made, not only for being the first animated movie ever made, but for being a story that has endured and been beloved by many for the last 87 years.

tt0029583,rw9093364,disharma-24131,Holds a special place in the history of animation,"""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is a timeless classic and one of the most beloved animated films of all time. Released in 1937, it was the first full-length animated feature produced by Walt Disney Productions. The film tells the story of Snow White, a beautiful princess who is forced into hiding from her evil stepmother, the Queen, who is jealous of Snow White's beauty.
One of the standout aspects of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is its stunning animation. Considering it was made over 80 years ago, the level of detail and artistry is remarkable. The hand-drawn animation brings the characters and the story to life in a visually captivating way. The use of vibrant colors and intricate backgrounds creates a magical and enchanting atmosphere that draws viewers into the fairy tale world.
The characters in the film are memorable and endearing. Snow White, with her kindness, innocence, and beautiful singing voice, quickly becomes a beloved heroine. The Seven Dwarfs, each with their distinct personalities and humorous quirks, provide both comic relief and heartwarming moments. The villainous Queen is also iconic, with her menacing presence and her transformation into the wicked witch adding an element of suspense and danger.
The music in ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is another standout feature. The film features several memorable songs, including ""Heigh-Ho"" and ""Whistle While You Work,"" which have become classics in their own right. The music enhances the storytelling and adds to the overall charm of the film.
The story itself is a timeless fairy tale with themes of love, jealousy, and the triumph of good over evil. It captures the imagination and appeals to audiences of all ages. While some aspects may be seen as dated by today's standards, such as the portrayal of gender roles and the somewhat simplistic narrative, it's important to remember the historical context in which the film was made.
Overall, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time. Its beautiful animation, memorable characters, enchanting music, and timeless story continue to captivate audiences of all generations. It holds a special place in the history of animation and remains a must-watch for any fan of Disney or animated films in general.",10.0,2023-06-01,1,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

For Disney's Very First Animated Feature & also the Very First Animated Movie in the Existence of Family Entertainment, I actually enjoyed it quite a bit.
Despite it being a Romance with the Main Character, Snow White & The Prince but overall i Mostly Enjoyed the Scenes with the Forest Animals cause their Cute & the Dwarfs cause their Hilarious & Entertaining throughout, And their Essential to the Entire Movie until near the End when Snow White was Awakened by the Prince's Kiss & Off to the Castle which we only get a Glimpse of from a Distance where Snow White & The Prince & his Horse stood Looking at.
And my Top Favorite Part was the Climax of the Movie near the End when the Witch Walks out from the Dwarfs Cottage & The Dwarfs & Forest Animals Immediately go after Her & Chasing her up a Rocky Cliff where she couldn't go any Farther & is Eventually taking down by a Bolt of Thunder which cause's her to Fall Down & also having the Boulder Fall on Top of her to Insure she Died from the Fall.

It's not as exciting or filled with as much witty remarks as today's animated features, but as soon as the dwarfs are introduced, the movie takes on an endearing lighter side. For the record, my favorite dwarf is Doc, because I can relate to him being a strong leader with some very humanistic follies, such as always getting tongue-tied (I do that myself all too often). All the songs stand out in their own way. 'Some Day My Prince Will Come' is a classic, fairy-tale ballad. 'Heigh-Ho,' 'Dig, Dig, Dig,' and 'Whistle While You Work' are great songs to pick up your spirits when you have to go to work, do chores, or do homework. And my favorite, 'The Silly Song,' is just a great, catchy, and funny song. As for the imagery, it's just breathtaking, especially considering how early it was introduced. The colors are rich and lively, and the multi-plane camera does add some great depth to the movie.
As you can tell, for an animation and Disney fan like myself, Snow White is a perfect milestone in the movie world. Even compared to the animation and storytelling styles of today, Snow White still stands the test of time. Kudos to everyone involved in this picture as their work will live on forever.

Adding more to the story in a just way. Such as the back story for the live interest that isn't really in the original animated and while fantastical and disneyfied brings out that disney magic that is true to these fairytale stories. Gripping you from the start with some outstanding songs that stick with you. Would pay to see again and again. Doesn't quite take the top spot for me but it's almost the best so far.

tt0029583,rw1041808,jboothmillard,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"This was the first full-length traditionally animated feature film, based on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale, the debut from animation genius Walt Disney, it took three years to complete, it is now recognised as an important contribution to cinema and was one of the highest-grossing movies of all time. Basically, beautiful, kind-hearted princess Snow White (Adriana Caselotti) lost her parents at a young age and lives in a kingdom with her wicked stepmother, the Queen (Lucille La Verne). Envious of her beauty, the Queen forces Snow White to work as a scullery maid in rags for clothes. The Queen asks her Magic Mirror (Moroni Olsen) ""who is the fairest one of all"" but is angered when one day it tells her that Snow White is fairer than her. One day, Snow White meets a Prince (Harry Stockwell) who overhears her singing (""I'm Wishing""), he scares her, and she runs away. He sings to her (""One Song""), and she falls in love with him from the balcony to the displeasure of the Queen. The Queen orders her Huntsman (Stuart Buchanan) to take Snow White into the forest to pick wildflowers, and there she wants him to kill her, which he is reluctant to do. She warns him of the penalty if he fails and tells him to bring back her heart in a jewelled box. The Huntsman cannot bring himself to kill Snow White and reveals the Queen's plot, saying she is mad with jealousy. He then urges her to run and hide and never come back. Snow White runs through the dark woods, getting lost encountering many scary trees, until she collapses from fright. When things calm down, many woodland animals surround her, she befriends and sings to them (""With a Smile and a Song""). She asks the creatures to help her find somewhere to sleep, and they lead her to a cottage deep in the woods. Finding many small chairs she assumes the cottage is home to untidy orphaned children. With the help of the animals, Snow White cleans the cottage (""Whistle While You Work""). Meanwhile, seven dwarfs named Doc (Roy Atwell), Grumpy (Pinto Colvig), Happy (Otis Harlan), Sleepy (Pinto Colvig), Bashful (Scotty Mattraw), Sneezy (Billy Gilbert), and Dopey (the noises of Eddie Collins) are working in a nearby mine digging for diamonds and other jewels (""Dig-a-Dig Dig"") until it is time to go home (""Heigh-Ho""). Snow White goes upstairs in the cottage and finds the dwarfs' beds and falls asleep on them. Returning home, the dwarfs are alarmed to see smoke coming from the cottage chimney, they suspect an intruder has invaded their home. They are also confused to find the house and cutlery cleaned, and a meal cooking in the pot. The dwarfs eventually investigate upstairs and find Snow White asleep. When she wakes, she guesses the dwarfs' names by their personality traits, and she introduces herself. She tells out that the Queen wants to kill her, and they welcome her stay after she offers to clean and cook for them. But Snow White says they will not get a bite to eat if they do not wash, so they reluctantly go outside to do so (""Bluddle-Uddle-Um-Dum (The Dwarfs' Washing Song)""). Back at the castle, the Magic Mirror reveals that Snow White is still alive; the Queen was tricked by the Huntsman with the heart of a pig in the box. Enraged, the Queen decides to go herself to the cottage to kill Snow White. She first creates a potion to disguise and transform herself into an old hag, a hideous Witch (Lucille La Verne). Meanwhile, Snow White and the seven dwarfs sing (""The Silly Song (The Dwarfs' Yodel Song)""), play music, and dance. After this, Snow White tells the dwarfs about the prince she is in love with (""Someday My Prince Will Come""). When it is time to go to bed, the dwarfs offer to let Snow White to sleep on their beds, while they sleep downstairs all over the cottage, including in the cupboards and sink. The Queen creates a poisoned red apple that will put whoever eats it into a death-like sleep. But she checks if the curse has an antidote and reads that the victim of the Sleeping Death can be revived only by ""love's first kiss"". The Queen has no fear of this, believing the dwarfs will think she is dead and bury her alive before this can happen. While the Queen leaves the palace during the night to go to the cottage, the next morning, the dwarfs leave to go to the mine. Snow White is making gooseberry pies when the Queen arrives at the cottage. The woodland animals realise the old woman is dangerous but are unable to warn Snow White. The animals rush to the mine to get the dwarfs, who eventually realise the danger Snow White is in. The Queen tricks Snow White into taking a bit from the poisoned apple, and she falls into a death-like slumber. As a storm hits, the dwarfs return as the Queen is leaving. She flees and they chase her through the woods up onto a cliff. She is trapped and tries to roll a boulder onto them, but lightning strikes the cliff, causing her to fall to her death, with the boulder crushing her. In the cottage, the dwarfs find Snow White poisoned. The dwarfs do not the heart to bury her in the ground, so they build a glass coffin and place her in the forest. Some time later, the prince learns of the maiden in eternal sleep in the coffin and arrives to see her (""One Song (Reprise)""). Saddened by her apparent death, he kisses her, and mourns with the dwarfs. Snow White suddenly wakes from her slumber, the dwarfs and the animals all rejoice as the prince picks her up. Snow White kisses all the dwarfs goodbye as the prince takes her on horseback to his castle. The colourful animation is impeccable, Snow White is sweet (if overly naïve), the dwarfs are all loveable, and the Queen (in both guises) is deliciously evil, the Queen's transformation sequence is genuinely eerie, and the music and songs are wonderful, it is a great classic animated musical fantasy. Walt Disney deservedly won an Honorary Oscar, presented by Shirley Temple, accompanied by seven miniature statuettes. The Queen was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, ""Some Day My Prince Will Come"" was number 19 on 100 Years, 100 Songs, the film was number 43 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, it was number 80 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, it was number 42 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, it was number 60 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons, it was number 3 on The Ultimate Film, it was number 49 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 80 on The 100 Greatest Films.

tt0029583,rw9568875,veinctor,Why the magic system sucks?,"This animation was history in the making and a marvel of animation, especially in 1937. Having 25 animated animals on screen is crazy, even for today's standards, almost 90 years later.

But judging with today's standards, some things do feel a bit off. I loved how the intro and outro show a book, but it has no vocal narration. This was fixed in Disney's next movie, Pinocchio.

Many things in the book's narration could have been animated, as the background info with Snow White's parents dying, is very interesting. But I get that we don't want to see a horror movie but a feel-good fairy tale.

My main problems have to do with the logic of the story: 1) I don't get why the queen is so obsessed with who is ""the fairest of them all"", whatever ""fairest"" means.

2) Why the queen has to ask a mirror? And how the mirror is magic? Who made the mirror? Why the Queen trusts the mirror? It doesn't matter I guess.

3) Why the queen didn't punish the Huntsman? I gues maybe she did but it's not something you want to show this to the kids. Being punished for being helpful teaches bad morals too.

4) Why the queen didn't send others after Snow White? If you want to do something right, do it yourself, I suppose.

5) Why the queen needed magic to change her appearance? Dramatic effect probably. And to show how evil she is. But how can she be sure that she can change back to how she was? Well, magic. And why she couldn't use magic to be fairest? I don't know, go along with it. It's a fairy tale.

So yes, I have my problems with the movie but I can't really blame the movie for them. It's magic, so, accept it. But that my problem with magic. You can do what ever you want with it and you can excuse anything with it if it's not grounded or if the rules are vague.

Saying all that, I have to forgive this movie as the whole movie industry was at it's infancy back then, still trying to find it's foot, and this movie left a very heavy footprint in the history of cinema. Fairytales back then were pure magic that nobody questioned, and the movie conveys just that.",9.0,2024-01-17,2,2,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt0029583,rw8980307,stewartb-21209,"A Timeless, timeless classic, a must see.","Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a timeless classic that has captured the hearts of generations of viewers since its release in 1937. Despite being nearly a century old, the film's enduring popularity is a testament to its remarkable storytelling, unforgettable characters, and stunning animation.
At the time of its release, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was a ground-breaking achievement in the world of cinema. It was the first full-length animated feature film ever created, and it set a new standard for the art form that would influence generations of animators to come.
But even beyond its historical significance, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs remains a truly great film. Its timeless story of love, jealousy, and redemption is as resonant today as it was nearly a century ago. The characters are memorable and lovable, from the innocent and kind-hearted Snow White to the mischievous and endearing dwarfs.
The film's animation is also a marvel to behold. Despite its age, the artistry and attention to detail in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs remain impressive, with vivid colours, fluid movements, and expressive character designs that still hold up today.
In short, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs may be an old film, but it is one that has stood the test of time. It is a true masterpiece of animation and storytelling, and it will continue to capture the imaginations of viewers for generations to come.
The story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has several psychological aspects that are worth exploring. One of the most interesting is the dynamic between Snow White and the seven dwarfs. Each of the dwarfs has a unique personality and represents a different aspect of human nature, making them intriguing psychological archetypes.
For example, Doc is the leader of the group and represents wisdom and order, while Grumpy is stubborn and resistant to change, representing the resistance to new experiences. Bashful embodies shyness and insecurity, and Happy represents joy and contentment. Sneezy and Dopey represent physical limitations and mental challenges, respectively, while Sleepy represents rest and the need for rejuvenation.
Snow White, on the other hand, represents purity, innocence, and beauty. Her relationship with the dwarfs highlights the power of human connection and the importance of different personalities coming together to form a supportive community.
The film's villain, the wicked queen, also has psychological significance as a symbol of envy, vanity, and jealousy. Her obsession with beauty and youth is a common theme in psychology and can be seen as a warning about the dangers of superficiality and the pursuit of perfection.
Overall, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a rich psychological story that explores a range of human emotions and behaviours through its diverse cast of characters. Its enduring popularity is a testament to its universal themes and the way it continues to resonate with audiences of all ages and backgrounds.",10.0,2023-04-08,1,1,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt0029583,rw8770880,MrBooligan,Where it All Started,"Walt Disney's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" succeeded even though Snow White herself is a bland character who primarily serves to inspire all of the fun side characters. She could be more expressive and funny, and other than being happy and cheerful doesn't offer a ton as a character in terms of personality or character development. The prince, suitably named The Prince, gets the same amount of background and character growth as thought that went into his name; none. At least Cinderella got Prince Charming. The Prince only shows up a few times in the movie and doesn't speak once. On top of that, Disney hardly follows the source material from the Brothers Grimm. This film was also very experimental, being Disney's first feature-length animated film and the first ever full-length animated feature in color. These aspects should have spelled disaster for this movie, but Disney knew what he was doing.
""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is as much fun as it is because Disney made sure to build the world of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" without worrying too much about the story. Of course, the story is a classic fairy tale with a jealous evil witch, a prince and princess, and danger to overcome. Still, the fun side characters and cute animals make this film a classic and not just a historical milestone for animation. All the dwarfs aren't just given their personalities with their names but express them exaggeratedly and charmingly. When things get scary or tense for Snow White, the cute forest animals help her and provide relief for the kids watching. This movie moves briskly and doesn't waste any of its 83-minute run time, filling every frame with detail and moving swiftly from one classic song to another (""Heigh-Ho"").
Some of that detail was realized due to Disney's innovation of the ""multiplane camera,"" simulating depth in animated films by having multiple drawings at different levels and moving them at different speeds and directions. This technique would be used for animated films for the next 60 years before computer animation took over. While ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" may feel cliché upon viewing in 2022, this all-time classic is what helped create most of the fairy tale movie tropes and clichés we've come to know, and the impact Disney made on the animation industry with this film in 1937 will be felt forever. 7.5/10.",8.0,2023-01-01,1,1,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

I grew up with a big love as so many of us for Disney, especially Pixar movies. Growing up streaming services like Disney + weren't a thing, not even dvd's and later on blu-ray existed when I was just a 5-year old watching Disney classics with my mom on a Sunday afternoon.
When the cinema around the corner from where I live announced they were doing a """"Disney 100"" ''marathon'' and announced they were going to show some of Disney's best and most classical movies I knew I had to go and try and watch them all (even though they are literally free and I have a big tv right here at home).

tt0029583,rw5471584,alexthegreatish,Snow White: Simple and Great,"The first full length animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is certainly a masterpiece. The animation is stunning, the music is timeless, and so on. To be honest, each scene is more heartwarming and cozy than the last. Besides the first and last five minutes of the movie, nothing bad really ever happens to the main characters. That's a refreshing change. If I have any gripes with the movie, it's that dumb Prince Charming guy. We first see him when he creepily sneaks up to Snow White and startles her. Snow White obviously flees, and Prince Charming has the nerve to be surprised. What a dope. Snow White then fantasizes about him for the rest of the movie (for some reason) until he shows up again at the very end. Somehow, he's even stupider by then. He kisses Snow White's corpse on the lips. A few things are wrong with this. First of all, I'm pretty sure that's illegal, for a number of reasons. Secondly, corpse germs are a real thing. Once Snow awakens, she runs off with him into the wilderness. I'm pretty sure he kills her, because we never hear from Snow White again. There's not even a bad Disney sequel about her. Now you might be wondering, why does Snow like this guy in the first place? Well, apparently she's only fourteen, so I guess it's just her teen hormones tricking her mind. Also, apparently there were supposed to be a bunch more scenes of Prince Charming in the middle parts of the movie that just didn't make the cut. I guess Walt realized that the Prince is such a simple transparent character that we didn't need any more scenes to explain his motivations. Anyway, besides it's little kinks, the movie does hold up incredibly well in the 21st century, especially considering it was made in the freaking 30's. The (mostly) lovable characters, along with the brilliant talents behind the scenes, make Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs one of the greatest Disney, nay, one of the greatest FILMS of all time. It's certainly the most watchable 30's film by today's standards. P.S. Doc is definitely the best dwarf!",8.0,2020-02-09,1,1,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt0029583,rw2680828,nintendogs03,"It's not fantastic, but it's the first Disney classics","I enjoyed watching this movie as a kid and it looked awesome! When I watched it with a friend, it just sounds so cheesy and predictable. It's the first animated movie ever so I give them credit for it's creation and dedication. It won't be all adventurous and complex like Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, but it's simple and lighthearted (a good path for Disney's first movie).
I got to be honest with you, but I can't stand Snow White! Her voice is do pitchy and annoying. She's so naive and sweet ugh! If I want a princess being my role model; I would turn to Belle for a Disney princess. I just don't like her. The Evil Queen is a lot prettier than Snow White. The Queen is one of my favorite Disney villains alone with Scar and Ursula. The Queen may have awful plans to become a hag (she should have turn Snow White into a hag instead of herself), but she's a ruthless and cold person in and out. She's arguably the best character that this movie has to offer. Second place are the woodland animals and third is the boulder.
The animation looks really good, even from 1937. I really like the colors that the animators used and it looks nicely done. No CGI was used to animate this movie so don't expect Snow White to look like Rapunzek or Princess Fiona from Shrek (her ogre form is prettier than Snow White is). And the scene with the Queen's transformation is nicely done- if this was done by hand, why can't animators these days draw backdrops and things and such? As you read my reviews, I'm not a fan of CGI except Tangled and a few other films.

tt0029583,rw9022609,julibufa,"A movie that still reveals the beauty of animation, as it did to people back in the 30s.","Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was the first full-length animated fairy tale adaptation by Walt Disney, which he spent years developing amidst a lot of pushback and disincentives. Out in 1937, it is the first animated classic, and holds more cultural relevance than any other Disney princess movie. The character first appears scrubbing the floors, happily singing a song. Starring a young princess in rags in the 18th Century searching for love, Snow White is a pure musical, which is astounding. Not Cinderella, nor Aladdin, nor The Lion King have as much music. As romantically vintage as it comes off, most of the dialogue rhymes, the characters expected to break into song frequently. The first song Snow White sings she does so to a wishing well. ""I'm Wishing"" has the most beautiful melody of the film, in my opinion; it fills me with nostalgia despite the fact I never saw this movie growing up. The worm's-eye view shot of her listening to the echo of the well slightly disrupted by water drops is still one of the most awe-inspiring images Disney has ever produced. It's a very sophisticated way of establishing the style of the film and it appears as though the animators are bragging about it a little bit.

Snow White is the perfect princess, because she loves everybody in the land. She shows compassion for the old woman, her stepmother, the dwarfs, all animals and creatures alike. The ""Prince"", who sings ""One Song"" by the wishing well, is the True Love that will give Snow White her true love's first kiss. The stepmother, simply named ""Queen"", calls upon the Magic Mirror and asks if she is the fairest in the land, only to be disappointed by the answer. Her menace is a strong point in the movie, giving children a scary villain to hold in contempt. She puts the plot in motion by sending a Huntsman to kill the girl, but he is unable. Not counting the animals, there are close to twelve characters in the film we get to know within a running time of 80 minutes. The Prince only has two scenes and one song, making him the flattest. Nevertheless, many others who appear a short amount each still display many recognizable features. The dwarfs come to life as soon as they appear. Chosen from a pool of dozens of gimmicks, the seven personalities of the dwarfs came to be during the production of this version. Everybody at least remembers Doc, the leader, Grumpy, the mean one, or Dopey, the black sheep. Singing the ""Heigh-Ho"" song, we see them walking back from work holding their pickaxes and tools on their shoulders in probably one of Disney's most recognizable shots.

Although the age of the picture is evident, there's a variety in its art and music that helps diversify the tone, awakening different visual and narrative possibilities in the film. The design of the little men is quite a contrast to those of the Princess and Prince. When Snow White first sees them, the dwarfs fall in love with her beauty and willingness as fast as they are invited to eat the supper she's cooked. I can see old conservative values in the motherly relationship Snow White presents, as she teaches the dwarfs how to cook and clean, and they as men only go to work, entitled to rest afterwards. However, it could be justified by looking at Snow White's role as a maid in the castle, which would had given her a lot of experience in home chores. This middle-portion in which the seven dwarfs do different things in the house is composed of several physical gags accompanied of orchestral music, each telling you the characteristics of the dwarfs. Grumpy will always be dismissive, and Doc will always command. When they play instruments Sneazy will be the flute, and Dopey the drums, and so on and so on. Considering the nature of such an ambitious children's project, despite the amusement of these scenes not being as intense as it may have been back then, it is understandable that they take up a significant chunk of the movie, as they have the most elaborate animated sequences.

Danger only comes at the end and it is narrow. The Queen disguises herself as an old lady and offers Snow White the poisoned apple. She is later chased down by the animals and dies crushed by a rock during a thunderstorm. Snow White is put under a glass casket. In the last five minutes, the Prince (after ""searching far and wide"" according to one measly intertitle) comes in and kisses her back to life. He then takes her to his Kingdom which looks like it's made out of gold and located up in the Heavens. Many things I've mentioned from this movie are as classic as the oldest conventions and as inescapable as the plot of Shrek, which parodies the Magic Mirror, the glass casket, the evil stepmother, the true love's first kiss, and other minor details like how it begins with a book being opened or the birds echoing what the princess sings. This movie is the basis for a formula that would first be xeroxed in the characters of Cinderella, who was also a maid for her stepmother, and Sleeping Beauty, who also experienced the Sleeping Death, or later subverted in modern characters like Belle and Mulan.

After all these years, Snow White is still the best out of the first handful of movies Disney made. I think it's better than Dumbo and Pinocchio, as it contains more material that ranges across different genres: from pure visual comedy when it comes to the dwarfs interacting with the music, to fully committed love serenades on the balcony of the Princess' castle. It's a little loose around the center but it kicks off in a magical way that is never lost as long as Snow White is on screen. The sudden fear of losing her at the end is only a device to give children a glimmer of hope to hang onto the character, that of course lives, insuring good triumphs in the end. This movie is from an era in which cinema had not seen that many things. If you think about the absolute achievement that it must have entailed back then to have animated something as romantic and creative, unsure of the results, and it turning to be the entire foundation that the company would sit on for a good hundred years, it puts Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in a unique place in cinema history like Star Wars or Toy Story. As a stand-alone adventure it is limited, but it's still amusing and alive in many ways, forcing you to fall in love with its world and characters.

But you have to see it all in perspective. This film was made about 65 years ago and I think it is a great accomplishment that the film can entertain people (including me) even now. I mean I'd rather watch this film (which is not perfect technically regarding today's standards) than watch Godzilla, The Avengers or Mission to Mars again. I honestly must say that the theme of the film has an approach that is well kind early 20th century but hey that's when it was made and although I didn't like that aspect very much I still enjoyed this film more than I did 2001's Artificial Intelligence (just to name one). The execution of the theme might be a bit old as may the animation techniques, but the good thing is that great humoristic scenes never lose their effect. My favorite dwarf? That's easy DOPEY. I mean the face he has and the stunts he pulls easily make him the funniest dwarf in my opinion and the one that deserves most of the grade I give this film.

tt0029583,rw1356820,kira_chicka,The Washing Song,"So I am a really good fan of OLD Disney movies and I really like to sit down and just watch them. So a couple of months ago, I guess, I was watching Snow White and I noticed that when the Seven Dwarfs go to wash their hands, before ""gooseberry pie"", Doc never once gets his hands wet, or his face wet. He just stands there and tells the other six Dwarfs what to do. I thought it was interesting and amusing that when Disney made Snow White they left that in there, as a small detail, unnoticeable to someone not paying good attention. I'm going to watch it again and look for some other things like this!

tt0029583,rw9699522,jazlennwilliams,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is beautifully scored and fun to look at,"The film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is about an Evil Queen, voiced by Lucille La Verne, who is so jealous of her step-daughter, Snow White who is voiced by Adrianna Caselotti, because of her beauty that she plots her murder. She first hires the Huntsman, voiced by Stuart Buchanan, and this attempt fails. She then takes matters into her own hands and decides to poison her. While the Evil Queen conspires against Snow White, the audience watches Snow White stumble upon friendship while trying to escape, and eventually true love after the Queen's demise.

Jealousy from step-mothers seems pretty common in Disney movies. In Cinderella, the step-mother and step-sisters were jealous of Cinderella's beauty, so much so that they tried to sabotage her chance at true love. The Evil Queen takes it to another level and has more heinous plans. The theme of jealousy is what drives the story and brings other themes of trust and betrayal and friendship to light. The Evil Queen is jealous but she feels a sense of betrayal from Snow White because how dare she be more beautiful than the queen herself. The Queen's hurt and jealousy and Snow White's fear of being murdered pushed Snow towards a beautiful friendship. The friendship between the Dwarfs and Snow White is fun to watch. It's very ""Goldilocks and the Three Bears"" when they find her sleeping in their beds and when they're all singing and dancing together, everybody is having a good time. It takes away from how dark the story is.

The music and lighting makes the movie interesting. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is beautifully scored and fun to look at, the music adds so much drama and keeps you hooked, especially when the queen is on screen. The scene where the dwarfs chase the queen off a cliff and the giant boulder falls on her, is the perfect example of this. The scene itself is so dramatic but the build up of the music during the chase scene is so impactful and truly immersive and the dark colors really add to how tragic the scene is. The scene of the Evil Queen making the apple poisonous and explaining her plan is so dark but the colors are so vibrant. It's beautiful watching the poison fall off the apple and it turns into a normal looking apple. The juxtaposition of colors when the scene is centered on Snow White or the Evil Queen adds so much to the already dramatic story and the good vs evil personality of the characters.

This movie is one of the more fun classic Disney princess movies to watch especially if you choose to believe that the Evil Queen is misunderstood. My daughter didn't like Snow White growing up so it's not one that I watched often but it would be a great movie to learn stranger danger from.

I'm not head-over-heels in love with this movie like some other people may be, mostly because Disney didn't really master stretching a story out to a full hour-and-a-half as they would later on, but I still think this movie's great. The animation has aged incredibly well, especially considering this was only 9 years after Steamboat Willie, you can definitely see the improvements. As for the story, it does have one, but a lot more focus is put on admittedly entertaining scenes that really only exist to pad out the runtime. The pacing is definitely the movie's major problem, as you've probably heard a lot of others say. The characters are alright. The dwarves are definitely the most entertaining and dynamic characters, a lot of the movie's comedy come from them. But Snow White and the Queen are pretty bland. And Snow White's rotoscoped face is the only bit of animation that has not aged well here, it just looks uncanny. Music has always been a staple for Disney movies, and this one has some pretty good songs, especially Whistle While You Work and Heigh-Ho. Oh yeah, and the ending is really abrupt.

Snow White is such a sweet character, selfless, gentle character. Her friendship with the dwarves is the highlight of this film (Dopey and Grumpy are my faves if I had to choose) and it's evident it takes plot precedence over her static, almost nonexistent relationship with the Prince character, where this romance (while kind of used as the plot device to resolving the climatic conflict) is not meant to be the ""deeper"" focus like other Disney animated films of the later half of the 20th century.

But regardless of what it's rated, everyone knows famous Disney classics like Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, and Alice in Wonderland are the classic Dinsey triangle.

An ambitious blend of wacky, stylized cartoon action and smooth, roto-scoped realism, Snow White still serves as a lovely slice of bright, cheery, kid-geared fantasy. Just seeing the whole thing through to the finish line was a significant achievement, amidst all the mainstream doubts and staggering financial risks. But it also stands tall on its own merits, from the bold, unforgettable character designs to the lasting, catchy musical interludes. I'm not sure the studio has ever matched this soundtrack, actually, both in terms of staying power and sheer sing-along-ability.
A few unsightly seams might show - clumsy little tricks to avoid the difficult camera angles and puzzling plot machinations to trim troublesome characters (which explains why the charming prince disappears for most of the film) - but animators were literally flying by the seat of their pants here, experimenting on-stage to test the viability of their chosen medium. I could nitpick about a whole lot of small items, but in a broad sense, it's the rare film that can still easily captivate a willing audience after eighty-plus years in the can. That alone is an incredible testament to the dedication, tenacity and enduring skill of the whole team, and the quality of the finished product.

Snow White was another unoriginal stories. At face value, the movie was pretty solid and looks innocent to say the least. The music, characters, were wonders. I'm a str8 dude and I would choose to watch Snow-White 37 than current animation nonsense because the movie was so calming and not annoying.

Alas, there's a lot of padding as time is spent on some cute forest creatures. The film picks up again with the entry of the seven dwarfs.

There are a few beautiful shots that really do the animation justice and showcase its value as a film medium. While the technical aspects of the film hold up, many of the factors contributing to the story do not. The characters in this film lack dimension, the dwarves are named what they do, with the exception of Doc, and while they provide comic relief and are visually entertaining, they do little to further the plot. They don't protect Snow White or save her from the queen, instead they have her clean up after and cook for them which, while Snow White seems happy with the arrangement, reinforces gender roles that were prevalent at the time. Snow White lacks individuality and isn't an interesting character. She is a passive character and doesn't take action, instead just letting things happen. The witch is simply an embodiment of evil and vanity. The prince sings a little and swoops in to the rescue at the end, but based on what the movie shows us about the characters, the prince is boring and Snow White would have been better off with the dwarves. While this is an animated movie based on a fairy tale and the goal of the film is to be visually entertaining, which it succeeds at, the story and the characters (except the dwarves) are forgettable. Snow White was a groundbreaking film and essentially the driving force in building the Disney Empire.

tt0029583,rw2214787,Reviewer14,The one that started it all is still the fairest one of all,"In early 1934, when production started,everyone thought Walt Disney was mad to make the first ever animated feature film. All that changed on December 21,1937, as Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs was embraced by not only critics, but everyone.
And how it is still loved today. Nobody gets old enough for Snow White, and I doubt anybody will.
It is simply the original fairytale, only animated. It has a few changes from the original tale, but really, I'd say the changes are for the better. The characters are amazing, each has their own unique look and personality to them,and the voice acting is outstanding.
The whole look of the movie is beautiful, every moment is enchanting. Out of every single film out there, and I'm just not talking about animated films, if there is one film that I think has the most beautiful moments, it's Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs.
The songs are simply a pleasure to hear. From 'I'm Wishing' to 'Someday My Prince Will Come', you'll fall in love.
Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs is the best animated film of all time. It may not be my favourite(That being The Lion King), but no doubt it is the BEST of all time. In fact, I think it's one of the best films of all time. It's simply incredible, with humour, drama, romance and even some intense scenes. I rented out the new Diamond edition a few weeks ago, and can I just say, it looks as if it were made yesterday, no lie.

tt6208148,rw10390860,imdbfan-9251139977,"The real life ""Emperor's New Clothes""","The 2025 adaptation of ""Snow White"" takes significant liberties with the classic fairy tale, resulting in a film that feels both disconnected and contrived. Rachel Zegler, cast in the titular role, emerges as a controversial choice, not merely for her distinct divergence from the traditional Snow White image, but more so due to her publicly voiced disinterest in the original film and character. This lack of affinity with her character's heritage is palpable, casting a shadow over her performance and making it difficult for audiences to connect with her portrayal of a beloved fairy tale figure.
Compounding the film's issues is the casting of Gal Gadot as the envious Queen, which strikes as particularly jarring. Gadot, undeniably charismatic, overshadows Zegler in scenes they share, which fundamentally contradicts the narrative's premise of overwhelming jealousy based on beauty. This casting misstep not only undermines the story's credibility but also disrupts the viewer's suspension of disbelief. The film thus struggles under the weight of its own casting paradox, resembling more a tale of ""the emperor's new clothes"" where the audience is expected to ignore the evident miscasting for fear of broaching sensitive topics.
Overall, Disney's attempt to modernize ""Snow White"" and imbue it with contemporary themes misfires, resulting in a film that neither honors its source material nor succeeds in crafting a compelling new vision. The film, rather than offering a fresh take on an old classic, comes off as an uninspired, muddled attempt that lacks both heart and coherence.",1.0,2025-03-21,64,13,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

Jonathan was also a nice addition to the film. It felt like he added to Snow Whites' story without taking anything away from her character.

What make this film so awful? First and formost; Rachel Zegler is so miscast, misdirected, and so out of touch with the charactor, she's painful to watch.

The rest of the actors actually do a decent job considering the material they had to work with. Gal Gadot made an interesting Evil Queen. However, her musical number was edited like an old MTV music video. They cut to different to different scenes as she's singing her song. Just comes across as choppy as the film itself. Don't blame Gadot, it was the director/writers/editor's fault.

Andrew Burnap did a nice job considering what he was given to work with. He would have made a perfect ""prince charming"" , but in another blundering attempt to ""update"" the story, he's uncessarily cast as a thief with a heart of gold instead. TOTALLY UNNECESSARY. Zegler is so weird and unlikable that the result is zero chemistry between him an her.

Dwarf CGI looks like a total afterthought. Strangely, they are never touched by any of the life characters. Was this because of cost cutting or just the afterthough of ""casting"" them. I don't know, but the lack of any compassion, caring, or closeness is quite noticable. The story is so disjointed it gives us the impression the actors were not engaged with the overall plot.

I wanted to give this a chance mostly because I love Gal Gadot. But, if you have a live action film, you can't colour it as if it was a cartoon. That's a hybrid film and has proven not to work, and it doesn't work here.
Also, they aren't dwarves. I don't know what they are but they aren't dwarfs.
Emilia Faucher who plays the young Snow White put in the best performance of any of the cast. That fact is shameful.
The magic mirror's voice, is that from the 60's?
And Gal Gadot has acted much better in the past. I don't know whether it was stresses with Zegler or simply a poor director but Gal was definitely not on form in this film.
And Zegler...well...she is literally playing a person who wants to impress on the screen. She's not playing a part of Snow White, she is very clearly trying to play anyway she can that she thinks will make her look good on screen. We've all seen it before but not in one so young.
That said, I tried to be objective about the film and no matter what you think of any of the people in their personal lives, the film is a poor remake, and takes the shine from the original because of it.

tt0029583,rw7325275,Spiderboy810,"This movie has aged. Not necessarily badly, but it has aged.","A while back, I decided that I was going to do a marathon of every single theatrical Disney animated movie (plus a couple of bonus movies I threw in there for fun), and the first movie on that list was, of course, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" When this movie first came out, it was a game changer. Up until then, animation was usually only regulated to just being a little five minute short you saw before the actual movie started. But this showed that animation was capable of so much more. If it weren't for this, all of the animated movies that we love would have never existed. And how well does this incredibly influential piece of entertainment hold up over 80 years later?

It's not bad.

Okay, I'd imagine that when this first came out, people must have been blown away by it. Then again, they didn't really have anything to compare it to. But today? Animated movies are now starting to rival live-action films. In my personal opinion, a lot of them even surpass live-action films. So when I see an hour-and-23 minute movie whose story could have been told in 30 minutes or less, don't expect me to compare it to something like ""Wall-E"" or ""Soul"" Yes, the story has quite a bit of filler and some of the scenes are pretty forgettable. Not only that, but a lot of the songs aren't exactly the best. Some of them are good, but others you won't remember for very long. A few days after watching it, you'll be able to remember maybe a few key scenes, but about 70-75% of the movie you'll forget about.

(Side-Tangent: Did anyone else notice how much of a creep the Prince was? Like, he broke into a woman's house, a woman whom he doesn't even know, and then at the end of the movie, he goes out to find her and then kisses her while she was under the effect's of the evil step-mother's spell. He did not know about that spell, so as far as he knew, he was making out with a corpse. Tangent over.)

Alright, now onto the good stuff, which there is plenty of. The first thing that jumped out to me was the animation style. All of the human characters are animated in this very unique way. It's as if they drew over a real-life actor doing the motions (if you saw the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about). In fact, I think that is how they animated it. It give the movie such a unique look that's unlike anything else today. It almost makes me wish that there was a whole movie animated just like that. Of course, all of the things that are animated normally still look great. I mean, it's Disney animation, it's kind of a given that it's going to look amazing and push boundaries. Now, I know that before that I said a few of the songs weren't amazing, but the songs that are good are pretty catchy. Something else this movie does really well is the writing. This goes for a lot of the movies during this early era of Disney, but this movie isn't really written like a movie. It written almost like a storybook or a fairytale, which is pretty fitting, I suppose.

All of these factors combined make ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" a unique experience unlike anything else made today, for better and for worse. So, should you watch this piece of Disney history? Sure. I mean, it's ""Snow White"" it's a classic.

This film is a complete misfire, both in terms of storytelling and execution, and honestly, I'm still wondering how it even got greenlit in its current form.
Let's start with the obvious: this is not Snow White. It's a hollow reimagining that strips away everything that made the original timeless. Gone is the heartwarming charm, the sense of wonder, and the emotional core. What we're left with is a preachy, politically charged narrative that seems more focused on pushing an agenda than telling a compelling story.
The lead performance lacks charisma and warmth. Snow White, once a symbol of kindness and innocence, is now cold, defiant, and unrelatable. While reinterpreting characters can work when done with care, here it feels forced and out of sync with the tone of the story. Supporting characters - including the dwarfs (sorry, ""magical companions"") - are either underdeveloped or completely unnecessary. The chemistry between characters is nonexistent, and many scenes drag without purpose.
Visually, the film is uninspired. The CGI looks cheap at times, and the costume design feels like it was ripped from a high school theater production. Even the forest - usually a place of magic and mystery - feels sterile and lifeless.
I'm all for updating classics and making them resonate with new generations, but it has to be done with respect and care. This version of Snow White feels like it was written by committee, afraid to commit to a clear vision and desperate to tick all the ""modernization"" boxes.
Disney has proven it can make successful live-action remakes (Cinderella, The Jungle Book), but this isn't one of them. It's not even close. If you're a fan of the original, I strongly advise skipping this one. It will only leave you frustrated, disappointed, and wondering why some stories can't just be left alone.",1.0,2025-03-22,81,18,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

GG should have her Hollywood star removed because of this performance. I don't personally like her acting choices, or lack ever thereof. And I find her politically to be in the same camp. She's been a major skip and I hope this solidifies her unbankability going forward. She, like the apple she gives out is box office poison. Her costumes were as horrible as her performance was campy. And I do not mean like good The Substance camp, nor But I'm a Cheerleader camp, just really really bad Joan Crawford impressionist camp. The castle might've been a literal putt putt course? And the seven emotions in human form were a little uncanny valley vibes at times but I think lord farquad Snow White did good in her 507 songs that she sang running through the forest hiding in the worlds brightest yellow dress you've ever seen. There were a lottttt of similarities in the script to the ongoing war in the Middle East, with Gal as the rightful villain but I'm not sure that the studio knows that it even did that. Nor that she's aware, clearly. It's either a brilliant calculation or a ""mistake"" on Disney's part. Rachel (lord farquad snow) has spoken out advocating for history's correct side and her being on the run from terror was honestly about as close to reality any Disney movie has ever gotten.

tt6208148,rw10406746,MunaymReviews,A Soulless Disaster That Should've Stayed in the Vault,"Disney's 2025 live-action Snow White is an absolute trainwreck-easily one of the worst films I've ever seen. It manages to butcher a beloved classic with uninspired performances, baffling creative choices, and some of the worst casting decisions in recent memory.
Let's start with the biggest disaster of them all: Gal Gadot. Somehow, she delivers an even worse performance than in Wonder Woman 1984-which I didn't think was possible. As the Evil Queen, she's neither menacing nor captivating; she's just painfully bad. Her line delivery is wooden, her facial expressions are awkward, and her attempt at villainous charm is laughable. At times, it feels like she's struggling just to remember her lines, and her singing? It's borderline offensive. She completely lacks the gravitas needed for the role, making every scene she's in a chore to sit through. Disney needs to do everyone a favor and never cast her in a major role again.
Rachel Zegler, as Snow White, is equally lifeless. She doesn't embody the warmth or charm of the original character, instead coming off as entitled and irritating. The chemistry between her and the Prince (or whatever they tried to turn the love interest into) is non-existent. The film's attempt to modernize Snow White by removing core elements of her story makes her character feel directionless, further dragging the already weak script down.
Visually, the movie is an eyesore. The CGI dwarfs look atrocious, the sets lack any kind of magical charm, and the whole film has this weird, cheap, over-processed aesthetic that makes it look more like a straight-to-streaming knockoff than a $200+ million Disney blockbuster.
And let's not forget the music. The new songs are completely forgettable, adding nothing of value to the film. Meanwhile, any attempt at nostalgia with the classic songs is ruined by poor arrangements and even worse performances.
If Disney was hoping this would breathe new life into their live-action remakes, they've failed miserably. Snow White (2025) is an insult to the original and a complete waste of time. Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs.",1.0,2025-03-26,49,9,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0
tt6208148,rw10423916,KrMaCoW,I hope the apple turns into a bomb,"Snow White (2025) is a complete failure on every level. Disney has taken a beloved classic and butchered it beyond recognition. From atrocious performances to painful visuals, this film leaves no room for anything redeemable. It's a soulless, joyless cash grab that insults its audience.
Rachel Zegler's performance is abysmal. Her lack of charisma and emotion makes Snow White completely unlikable. Every line delivery is cringe-worthy, as she stumbles through scenes with no sense of character. Even her singing, while technically competent, is emotionless and flat. It's hard to believe this is the best they could find for such an iconic role.
Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen is nothing short of a disaster. Her delivery is stiff, her expressions are cartoonish, and her attempts at menace fall flat. Instead of a terrifying villain, we get a campy, awkward caricature. She's not intimidating - she's embarrassing. Gadot's performance will undoubtedly be remembered for all the wrong reasons.
The CGI in this movie is an insult to the audience. The enchanted forest looks like a low-budget video game from a decade ago. The dwarves are unsettling, resembling poorly-rendered digital puppets with zero charm. Every visual choice reeks of laziness and a lack of creative vision. This wasn't a magical world - it was a visual dumpster fire.
Snow White's costume looks like a cheap knock-off from a discount store. The fabric choices are gaudy, the colors clash, and the design is laughably unflattering. Her hairstyle only adds to the disaster, leaving her looking more like a failed cosplay than a Disney princess. The Evil Queen's attire is no better, with a design that borders on parody.
The songs in Snow White (2025) are painfully bland and forgettable. Not one tune stands out, and the lyrics feel like they were slapped together at the last minute. Even Zegler's vocals can't salvage the uninspired mess. Disney's once-magical musical legacy is nowhere to be found here.
Snow White (2025) is an unmitigated failure. Disney has managed to destroy everything that made the original special. There's no heart, no wonder, and certainly no respect for the source material. Watching this film is a miserable experience from beginning to end. If you're tempted to see it, don't. Revisit the animated classic instead - it's everything this monstrosity isn't.

By the end of the movie it left us not caring about any of the characters, the story was just pointless and terrible, and the CGI characters were more like monsters to the kids than dwarfs. The magical creatures people were talking about in line were also pointless. Gal did the best with the wooden lines she was given, and Snow White was just a weird character herself. It was probably the worst written show to come out of Disney ever, so hopefully they will redeem themselves with a brand new idea! I remember when they came up with new ideas every year or so like The Little Mermaid and those shows were great for the parents and the kids.... It doesn't seem like there is any creativity left at Disney. Definitely DO NOT spend your hard earned money on this film. Take the kiddies to the ZOO instead until Disney figures it out....",2.0,2025-03-22,32,6,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

I was not expecting to like this movie much - the original is a masterwork for its time, but is dated. If this version had been a shot-for-shot remake, it would have been a waste of time.
Instead, the filmmakers took the core of the story, made it accessible to today's audience, infused it with amazing original music and dance, and produced something I'd gladly see again with my grandchildren.
Gal Gadot gave a great performance, in all aspects. Rachel Zegler used her innocence, beauty and voice to embody a hero we can all love. Andrew Burnap was Robin Hood-esque in heroism and charm.

tt6208148,rw10391413,Eric_Tweener,Basic but inoffensive,"Snow White, the latest in Disney's line of uninspiring remakes, is an effort that slightly surpassed my expectations. Not something I think will be fondly remembered, but the vitriol in reaction to its existence seems especially unearned.
The writing is quite average, but I appreciate that it tries a somewhat fresh take. While not diverging too much from the basic narrative of the 1937 film, it tries to add depth to Snow White and the substitute Prince character and extends the runtime by some other means. Not groundbreaking, but I at least felt like I was watching an actual re-adaptation of the source material instead of just a CGI'd up live action rendition of the original movie. Kenneth Branagh's Cinderella was one where it stuck very close to the original while barely adding anything of substance, making it feel hollow despite very nice filmmaking. Sure, I'd say it's a better overall film than this Snow White, but the latter is the format I would prefer a remake to follow.
The technical aspects of the movie could have been improved upon. The cinematography and color grading do very little to make it a visually exciting experience although nothing was distractingly bad. The visual effects, however, were distracting. The animals take on a cartoonish appearance but that only serves to make them look fake the entire time. The dwarfs are the worst offender; their designs are just unappealing and there's a degree of uncomfortability every time they're on screen, especially Dopey. The ""Heigh-Ho"" sequence, which is likely 100% CGI, is probably the worst part of the movie. Making the dwarfs live action would probably have made the movie overall more palatable.
The music is solidly executed. It does away with a large part of the music from the 1937 film, and the new songs are alright. I think I would've preferred the music to sound ""bigger"", and there is some noticeable autotune, but I found this movie to definitely handle music better than some of the other remakes.
Snow White is just another Disney remake but I found it justifies its existence more than some others in the lineup. I've seen almost all of the recent ones and I definitely prefer the likes of Pete's Dragon and Dumbo to Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King. Snow White isn't particularly impressive, but it did hold my attention and my impression was overall positive despite some hiccups.",6.0,2025-03-21,41,478,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

tt0029583,rw10088069,axtiik,That's great,"""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is a legendary animated film that almost everyone who grew up with classic Disney stories knows. This tale is an integral part of culture, as it became the first full-length animated movie by Walt Disney Studios. For many, including myself, it is a childhood memory that has left a deep imprint on the heart. When you rewatch it, it not only brings nostalgia but also stirs new, more mature emotions.

From childhood, I remember this movie as a wonderful, magical story about love, friendship, and justice. The main plot, where Snow White flees from the evil queen and finds shelter in the dwarfs' house, highlights the values of kindness and mutual help. Each character-especially the dwarfs-has their own unique charm. As a child, I saw each dwarf as fun, magical, and slightly mysterious. But as I grew older, my perspective changed, and now I feel a special connection with Grumpy. Perhaps I, too, have become more like him over time-slightly grumpy, more realistic, but still someone who values truth and simple joys in life.

Every time you rewatch ""Snow White"" as an adult, you notice new details that might have gone unnoticed in childhood. The animation, which was revolutionary for its time, is still impressive in its craftsmanship. Although it may seem simple compared to modern technology, it holds a special atmosphere and magic that is hard to recreate with computer graphics. I admire how the creators of the film managed to convey the emotions of the characters through simple yet precise movements and facial expressions. In my opinion, this is the feature that makes the movie feel so alive and human.

We can't forget about the musical accompaniment of the movie. The songs from ""Snow White"" still play in my mind whenever I think of classic Disney melodies. They add even more charm to the story, enhance the emotional moments, and even become symbols of the characters themselves. For example, the dwarfs' song ""Heigh-Ho"" is a true anthem of work and the simple pleasures of life.

However, if we talk about how my perception of this fairy tale has changed with age, it's definitely my attitude toward Snow White herself. As a child, she was the embodiment of purity, goodness, and beauty. Now, I see her character somewhat differently-she seems overly idealized. Her kindness and naivety, though attractive, appear a bit unrealistic in the context of the real world. But this only emphasizes that the film is designed to teach children essential values-love, compassion, and generosity, even if it does so through some idealization.

Overall, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is not just a movie; it's a cultural heritage that has passed through decades and continues to be a beloved story for many generations. Even if, like me, you've become a slightly grumpier viewer over time, this film can still transport you to that world of childhood innocence and belief in goodness. And although you might now view some aspects more critically, the magical atmosphere, warm feelings, and charm this story evokes remain unchanged.

I recommend rewatching ""Snow White,"" especially if you haven't done so in a while. Like me, you may gain a new perspective on this timeless fairy tale, but the sense of magic and kindness will accompany you long after the credits roll.",7.0,2024-10-24,0,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

tt0029583,rw3412347,rannynm,"A Timeless Tale With A Powerful Message About Teamwork, Friendship, And Fighting For What's Right","Snow White is a beautiful retelling of a classic film. It has catchy music and amazing acting, while also presenting an incredibly creative story. An amazingly talented cast and gorgeous sets makes it feel truly magical.
Based on the 1937 classic Disney animated film, the story follows Snow White (Rachel Zegler), a princess who was hidden away by her stepmother, the Evil Queen (Gal Gadot), after her father left. After having enough of her stepmother, Snow White joins forces with seven dwarfs to bring her kingdom to peace once again while they help her take down the Evil Queen.
The songs in this film, composed by Jeff Morrow, Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, are expertly crafted and catchy. Every song got stuck in my head until I heard the next one, and the incredible voice talent enhances them even more. My personal favorite has to be ""Whistle While you Work"" - Rachel Zegler's voice brings incredible energy and whimsy to the song, plus I love how the whistling is used in it. The sets and cinematography, directed by Mandy Walker, are also beautiful - the lighting stands out as it works perfectly and mixed with the magnificent sets creates a fantastic looking film. One shot I really love is when we first see the cottage in the forest. The costumes, designed by Sandy Powell, are also quite beautiful; however they don't all seem to go together. Each set of costumes feels like it was meant for a different time period, which feels a bit disconnected. I really like the Evil Queen's costumes; they're flawless and not only fit the kingdom, but also her character. The characters are really well scripted, and I love the actors for each of the key characters. I especially love Rachel Zegler's performance; the amount of emotion she shows brings so much life into her character and made me feel really sympathetic for her. This film had me enchanted the whole time through its story, songs and acting.
The film's message is to follow your morals and beliefs, even if it may not present easy decisions. Be warned that there are intense scenes and blood shown at some points.
I give Snow White 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to12. It releases in theaters March 21, 2025.

If the goal was to drain every ounce of charm, whimsy, and storytelling from the original and replace it with awkward performances and out-of-touch messaging, then mission accomplished.
Let's talk about Rachel Zegler. Her portrayal of Snow White felt like she accidentally wandered in from a completely different movie... and didn't bother reading the script. I've seen more emotion and sincerity in high school drama class performances. And that's just on set. Off set, her interviews came off as arrogant and dismissive-almost like she resented the fact that the original even existed. You'd think someone starring in an iconic remake would at least pretend to care.
This wasn't a modern reimagining. It was a complete dismantling of a classic tale in favor of something painfully forced and joyless.

What should have been a magical reimagining of a beloved classic turned into a drawn-out slog that left me checking my watch more than once.
The writing was painfully lackluster, filled with cringeworthy dialogue that felt more like a series of cliché catchphrases than genuine conversation. The plot meandered endlessly, lacking the charm and coherence that made the original so endearing. The awkward pacing made it hard to connect with any of the characters, particularly Snow White, who came off as bland and forgettable.
As for the cast, despite some commendable performances, they were working with very little. The dwarves, often the heart of the story, were reduced to caricatures, losing any semblance of depth or personality. Meanwhile, the villain was diminished to a mere shadow of her former self-more annoying than threatening.
Visually, while the film showcased some impressive scenery and effects, they often felt overused and distracting rather than enhancing the story. Instead of immersing us in the fairy tale world, it felt like a flashy cover hiding an empty shell.

The Good:

Rachel Zegler's singing - as expected, her vocal talent shines through.

Gal Gadot looking stunning, as she always does.

... And that's about it.

The Bad:

Rachel's unfortunate hairstyle - a missed opportunity for a more classic, timeless look.

Rachel's portrayal of Snow White feels like cosplay without character. There's little of the classic Snow White essence beyond the costume.

The addition of a ""bandit lover"" feels forced, seemingly included to avoid the ""problematic"" prince-saving trope. Ironically, the kiss to save Snow White still happens, raising the question: would you rather be saved by a prince or a criminal?

The bandit lover's ragtag group attempts a fight scene so awkwardly choreographed that it felt like a parody from Robin Hood: Men in Tights. Prancing and kicking armored men with swords? Good Lord!

Dopey has been reimagined to the point where you can't even call him Dopey anymore.

Gal Gadot's performance started strong for a good 10 minutes, showing improvement from her Wonder Woman days. However, the same can't be said for the remainder of the film.

The ending - Snow White ""saves the day"" by asking everyone to just reminisce about the ""good old days."" Which leads to the Evil Queen rage quitting into the magic mirror after witnessing this ""Brave"" and ""Stunning"" event. Not exactly the empowering, dynamic conclusion one might expect.

And finally, the new songs are forgettable and bland - a poor attempt to recreate the magic of the original. The worst part? They cut two of the most iconic songs. We already know why they axed one of them, and that itself is already a travesty. Why remake Snow White if you're going to gut what made it memorable?

I imagine that with today's computer generated graphics you could come up with a more realistic animation. But it would probably frighten the children and in all the wrong places. More than the wicked queen would be frightening folks.
Snow White is a tale of imagination, something that lets the kids work their minds and really get into the characters. The voices selected so perfectly match the animated figures. And with the exception of Billy Gilbert they're not known players. Snow White is first and foremost a character driven story. Today the Disney Studio would probably take from their stable of TV and film personalities for voices, but the emphasis would be on the celebrities not the story. I don't think Disney Studios alone would be guilty of that however.
Much as I like the simple story, the thing I love best about the film is the musical score that Frank Churchill and Larry Morey wrote. This is the Annie Get Your Gun of animated films, so many different and beloved hits come out of it. Even today you can hear people offhandedly humming 'Heigh Ho, Heigh Ho' and they might not realize where it's from, it's so ingrained in our consciousness, almost like Happy Birthday.
A favorite song of mine is the operatic ballad One Song that the prince and Snow White both sing. I have a recording of it that Allan Jones did and it's a gem. It could have come out of a score by Sigmund Romberg or Rudolf Friml, it's that good.
The movie DVD is still a hot seller, it's like White Christmas and the other Christmas songs that Bing Crosby did which still keep his name before the public every Yuletide season and keeps making money for his estate. Why is Snow White so popular? Very simply it's one of the best cartoon features every made.",10.0,2009-12-08,11,4,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

tt6208148,rw10396656,Simonscoop,"A diluted, hollow reflection of a beloved classic","Disney's 2025 live-action remake of Snow White had every opportunity to breathe new life into the studio's first full-length animated film - a landmark in cinematic history. But instead of standing as a fresh yet respectful reinterpretation, this version lands as a soulless, uninspired echo of a story that once brimmed with magic, charm, and heart.

Directed with a strangely detached tone and lacking the visual wonder that characterized the original 1937 masterpiece, the remake seems more concerned with checking boxes than telling a timeless tale. Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White, while technically competent, struggles to capture the gentle innocence and warmth that made the character so endearing in the original. Her version of Snow White feels modernized to a fault - distant, overly serious, and stripped of the sweetness that defined her animated counterpart.

The much-discussed reimagining of the seven dwarves - reduced to a vague band of mismatched companions - feels less like a bold creative choice and more like a studio unsure of how to handle legacy characters. Regardless of one's stance on the controversy, the result is narratively weak. These supporting characters, once full of personality and humor, are now flat and forgettable.

Even setting aside the pre-release discourse surrounding casting and representation, the film's real failure lies in its creative redundancy. The musical numbers are lifeless retreads of songs that once soared, now delivered with little of the whimsy or warmth that made them iconic. The production design, while expensive-looking, lacks the storybook magic that made the original a visual wonder. Worst of all, the emotional core - the bond between Snow White and the woodland creatures, the terror of the Evil Queen, the joy of ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" - is all either toned down or missing entirely.

Ultimately, Snow White (2025) is not a disaster, but it's disappointingly mediocre. And that mediocrity is more damning than any of the noise surrounding it. The film simply doesn't justify its own existence. It offers no meaningful improvement, no unique angle, and certainly no charm to rival its predecessor.

I am not entirely sure how you managed to rip the soul of this more than you did the Little Mermaid. It's quite bizarre how you could have miscast this so badly. No chemistry between any of the leads. The story was mediocre at best and the attempts at humour fell extremely flat. So many continuity issues to mention as well.
The only 2 parts of the movie I truly enjoyed were 'Hi Ho' because I really did rather like the animated Dwarves, especially Dopey who I think was truly adorable. And 'Whistle while you work' was equally sweet and did have a smidge of that ol' Disney magic. But all of the new songs were instantly forgettable though. And Gal Gadot was not the evil queen we deserved. I had secretly hoped that Lana Parilla would be typecast into her role... because really, who could ever match her. Certainly not Gal. Her Evil Queen went out with a whizz pop, not a bang completely robbing us of seeing the comeuppance of good vs evil finale she (and the audience) deserved.

Well over a decade, maybe two. It's weird because I obviously remember the broad strokes of this movie but I definitely forgot a lot of the details and little story notes. I find myself experiencing some real Orwellian doublethink now that I watch this. From a storytelling standpoint... This is not good. Yes, there are some dark moments that were surprising but the actual story here is pretty minimal. The evil queen wants to kill the pretty princess, the princess escapes and then just randomly becomes the house guest of these odd little dudes and teaches them to all stop living like pigs, and then she falls for the MOST OBVIOUS EVIL APPLE EVER. Prince eventually shows up, kisses her, and then just... Done? How is that true love? The princess is so young... Are the dwarves all crotchety old men or are they wee youngins with flowing beards? Regardless why is she just breaking into someone's house and messing with stuff? The animation on Snow White feels... Weird and not quite right. It feels so much like a proto-story that acts as the building block for something else but on its own...
But that's where the doublethink sinks in. On the surface, just watching the movie and thinking of nothing else, I'm underwhelmed. But when I start thinking of everything this did for cinema, for animation? Snow White really was the foundation that Disney has built itself on. It changed the game with Snow White and by doing that gave birth to one of, if not the, largest and most successful studios to date. How does that stack up? How exactly do you properly weigh the significance of a film that spawned so much even if it's not necessarily amazing on its own? I often make the argument that Iron Man is the best Marvel movie because the whole franchise owes itself to Stark and Snow White is the exact same thing, I just don't feel that same connection to the material here.
I really have to put this on that list of films that are fun to watch for historical purposes, for the cinephiles out there, for the impact is has on cinema but I don't actually enjoy it all that much. In that way, I put it in the same realm as Citizen Kane. The realm of films that, intellectually I am glad to have seen but I have no resonance with them, they don't linger with me as anything other than strictly academic achievement. With that in mind, if you're interested in checking out a formative piece of film history? This is obviously available on Disney+, making it pretty easy to find and check out. If you're looking for entertainment or a story though, I'd really recommend one of the myriad other Disney animated films that owe thanks to Sleeping Beauty but also surpass it in a number of ways.",6.0,2022-07-27,0,7,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

Story & Plot: The plot itself is uninspired, offering little more than a dull retelling of the original story. While the 1937 version was groundbreaking, enchanting, and full of heart, this 2025 version misses the mark. It lacks the charm, the emotional depth, and the timeless appeal that made the original Snow White so memorable. The story feels rushed and shallow, with key moments that should have felt emotional or dramatic falling flat. It's a forgettable experience rather than a captivating reimagining.
The Lead Actor: Perhaps the biggest issue with this Snow White is the casting. The main actor simply does not fit the role. Snow White is supposed to be innocent, charming, and full of life-but in this version, the actor feels out of place. There's no warmth or connection with the audience. She fails to evoke the same tenderness and strength that made the 1937 Snow White a beloved character. It's hard to care about her journey when her portrayal feels so disconnected from the essence of the character.
Comparing to the 1937 Classic: It's clear that the 1937 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a far superior film. That version, with its groundbreaking animation and heartfelt storytelling, has remained a timeless classic for a reason. This 2025 retelling lacks the warmth, depth, and enchantment that made the original such a success. The performances were strong in 1937, with each character bringing something unique and memorable. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for this modern version.
Conclusion: In short, the 2025 Snow White is a disappointing attempt at reviving a beloved classic. The story is flat, the lead actor is miscast, and it simply doesn't do justice to the original 1937 film. For anyone looking to relive the magic of Snow White, it's best to stick with the 1937 version, which remains the definitive and much more enjoyable take on the tale.

tt6208148,rw10404809,MovieCriticOnline,The original version v. this monstrosity,"First, I am not sure why Disney can't make more original movies instead of the endless remakes. It shows where we are at today, totally devoid of any creativeness.
I wanted to compare the actual original story of Snow White with this new version. Especially the ending.
In the Grimm's book, the queen made one apple, but it was only PARTIALLY poisoned, the red side, the white side was fine and the queen offered Snow White the red side while eating herself the white side. When Snow White died, the Queen went back to the castle and asked the ""Looking-glass against the wall, Who is fairest of us all?"" at last it answered, ""You are the fairest now of all.""
After the dwarfs found Snow White dead they made a glass coffin for her and sat her on the mountain hill where one day the Prince rode by and offered to by her, but they first refused, until he promised to take care of her and them so the finally agreed to bring the coffin to the Castle, but on the way ""they stumbled over a bush, and with the shaking the bit of poisoned apple flew out of her throat. It was not long before she opened her eyes, threw up the cover of the coffin, and sat up, alive and well.""
While the prince and Snow White got married the Queen asked the looking-glass answered, ""O Queen, although you are of beauty rare, The young bride is a thousand times more fair."" The queen railed and cursed, and was beside herself with disappointment and anger. The queen felt she should have ""no peace until she went and saw the bride. And when she saw her she knew her for Snow-white, and could not stir from the place for anger and terror. For they had ready red-hot iron shoes, in which she had to dance until she fell down dead.""
So the queen didn't die until AFTER the wedding. Back to this new monstrosity version.
The cast was totally miscast, from Gal being way too beautiful compared to Rachel playing Snow White. It was almost laughable the stark contrast it was. The whole point of the original Snow White is the Queen was jealous of Snow White's beauty.
The original Snow White, she was a kind, selfless person that enjoyed cleaning for the 7 dwarfs, but the new one she went straight to sleep. Is cleaning and cooking that offensive these days?
Then, the atrocious looking CGI garden gnomes of the 7 dwarfs, cause apparently it was offensive to hire actual dwarfs. This is PC running amok. And unlike the original Disney characters who were distinctly different, here they all kinda looked the same.
And a lot of the important, cute exposition from the original is missing, like when Snow White comments on the names of the dwarfs after she cleans, the new one she just goes to sleep right away, like she is entitled to sleep there, compared to the original where she verbalized that IF she cleaned their place they may let her stay, in other words, she wanted to do a good deed in hopes of getting something in exchange.
The prince wasn't even a prince, he was just some thief and no real good reason why she fell for him, he was kinda annoying. That whole bandit story was utterly pointless and the ending was atrociously embarrassing.",1.0,2025-03-26,23,3,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

As a fan of the original classic, I was expecting a fresh, thoughtful retelling, but instead, I was left with a complete disappointment. This film was a waste of both my time and money.
The most glaring issue for me was the character of Snow White herself. Instead of being the strong, iconic figure she was in the original, she was reduced to a joke. Gone was the grace and depth that made her memorable. Instead, she was written as a clumsy, uninspiring character with no real substance. Her portrayal was not only disappointing but downright cringeworthy at times, making it hard to take the film seriously. The way they handled her role felt more like a parody than a reimagining of the beloved princess.
The performances across the board were underwhelming. Despite the film's star-studded cast, the acting was flat, and the chemistry between the characters felt forced. The dwarfs, instead of being endearing, felt awkward and out of place, and the film's attempt at humor fell painfully short.
Visually, the movie had some moments of impressive CGI, but even that couldn't mask the film's lack of heart. The effects felt overdone, and the magical elements didn't evoke the wonder they should have. The pacing was slow, and the plot was uninspired.

Overall, Snow White 2025 is a prime example of a remake that misses the mark in every way.

This film is nothing but a hollow, corporate greedy remake of a beloved and charming Disney movie. I have been an avid Disney fan for over 30 years. I have seen every theatrical release up until this point and plan to you doing so because I am an avid fan. However, even the Disney's biggest fans cannot continue to justify these god-awful remakes that continuously get pumped out because this company is so desperate to get money and people in the seats watching these things. This movie is horribly casted with a few bad performances as well as some OK performances but overall very disappointing. I do not care for this Rachel Ziegler person, but she did nothing in the film to capture who Snow White is as a character or do anything to bring her to life on screen, which is a shame because I remember how much the original and film meant to me as a child.

tt6208148,rw10391050,imdbfan-2468280347,Too Much of Nothing - Not Even Worth a Stream,"Another poor remake with a B-grade cast trying desperately to make something of themselves. From the moment the film begins, it's apparent this is not the enchanting tale we all grew up loving. The magic, the charm, the warmth-none of it is present. Instead, what we're given is a hollow, uninspired reimagining that lacks soul, cohesion, and even basic cinematic appeal.
Let's start with the acting. At best, it's wooden; at worst, it's completely detached. The cast seems awkwardly thrown together, and not one performance manages to stand out in a meaningful way. The lead lacks the charisma and emotional depth to carry the weight of such an iconic character. There's no gravitas, no growth, and certainly no spark that would make her believable as the ""fairest of them all."" Supporting characters fare no better. Most feel like afterthoughts-poorly written and poorly portrayed. The chemistry between characters is non-existent, making it incredibly difficult to care about any of them or their fates.
The singing-another key component of any Disney musical-is underwhelming at best and jarring at worst. The original Snow White had unforgettable melodies that have endured for generations. In contrast, this remake offers forgettable and at times cringe-inducing musical numbers that feel shoehorned in rather than seamlessly woven into the narrative. Whether due to lackluster vocal performances, uninspired arrangements, or poor sound mixing, the musical moments consistently fall flat. Songs that should have elevated the emotion of a scene instead serve as distractions or unintentionally comedic breaks.
Visually, the film is also a disappointment. While Disney usually prides itself on delivering cinematic eye candy, this movie's CGI feels overdone and artificial. The enchanted forest lacks wonder, the animals lack personality, and the once-iconic imagery-like the Evil Queen's mirror or the dwarfs' cottage-feels generic and stripped of any visual identity. Even the costumes and set designs feel like low-budget approximations rather than thoughtfully crafted elements of a fantasy world.
Narratively, this remake tries too hard to be different and ends up losing the essence of what made the original beloved in the first place. In attempting to modernize the story, the filmmakers have abandoned the timeless qualities of love, kindness, and humility that defined Snow White. Instead, we're given a confused message that doesn't know whether it wants to be a fairy tale or a social commentary. It's possible to update a story for modern audiences while respecting its roots, but this film fails on both fronts. The pacing is also inconsistent-some scenes drag on with unnecessary dialogue, while others rush through important plot points with no emotional payoff.
Character development is sorely lacking. The Evil Queen, who should be a terrifying and iconic villain, comes off as flat and one-dimensional. Her motivations are murky, her presence barely menacing. Meanwhile, the dwarfs-once the heart and comic relief of the original-are reduced to mere caricatures, each lacking distinctive personalities or memorable moments.
It's also worth noting that the film's tone is all over the place. At times it feels like it's trying to be serious and grounded; at other times, it leans into goofy slapstick with no transition or consistency. This tonal confusion makes it hard to understand what kind of audience the film is even trying to appeal to.
All in all, this remake of Snow White is a misfire on almost every level. It lacks the magic, the heart, and the timeless charm that made the original a classic. Disney needs to seriously reconsider its strategy with these live-action adaptations. Nostalgia alone isn't enough. If they continue down this path-relying on mediocre casts, uninspired scripts, and tone-deaf storytelling-they'll continue to churn out flops that tarnish the legacy of their beloved animated originals.

First, the script is unbearably dull, filled with lifeless dialogue and forced ""modern"" updates that strip away the charm of the original. The changes to the story feel unnecessary and out of place, turning an enchanting fairy tale into a preachy, joyless slog.
The casting is another major issue. The lead performance lacks charisma, making Snow White more annoying than endearing. The supporting characters are forgettable, and the film completely mishandles its interpretation of the dwarfs, replacing them with unmemorable stand-ins that add nothing to the story.
Visually, it's a mixed bag. While some of the CGI looks decent, many scenes feel overly artificial and uninspired. The costumes and set design are bland, failing to capture the magic of the original film. Even the musical numbers, which should be a highlight, are flat and unmemorable.
Overall, Snow White (2025) is a soulless cash grab that completely misses the heart of the story. Instead of celebrating a classic, it awkwardly tries to ""modernize"" it in all the wrong ways. Disney needs to stop with these lifeless remakes and start focusing on original storytelling again.

tt6208148,rw10416205,sahaz,Catastrophe,"There are bad movies, and then there's this-a film so insufferably awful that it transcends mere incompetence and becomes an endurance test for anyone unfortunate enough to sit through it. Calling this a movie feels generous. It's more like a cruel social experiment to see how long an audience can tolerate excruciating boredom, mind-numbing stupidity, and an utter lack of artistic merit before they walk out, screaming for their money back.
Let's start with the plot-or rather, the complete absence of one. The script is a disaster of epic proportions, seemingly cobbled together from rejected high school creative writing assignments. It lacks coherence, structure, or any semblance of narrative momentum. Characters stumble aimlessly through scene after scene with no clear motivation, engaging in dialogue so vapid and cringe-inducing that you'd swear it was AI-generated by a malfunctioning chatbot. Nothing happens for long stretches, and when something finally does happen, it's either idiotic beyond belief or so predictable that it might as well have been telegraphed in neon lights.
The dialogue is an abomination. Every line feels like it was written by someone who has never heard human beings speak. The characters trade lifeless, robotic exchanges filled with clichés, awkward exposition, and failed attempts at humor that land with the grace of a brick through a windshield. It's as if the screenwriter actively despised the audience and wanted to punish them with each groan-worthy line.
The performances are somehow even worse. It's almost impressive how every actor in the film manages to deliver their lines with the same dead-eyed, soul-draining monotony. Whether they are supposed to be experiencing joy, sorrow, or terror, their expressions remain frozen in a permanent state of confused indifference. The lead actor, in particular, gives a performance so staggeringly wooden that it makes mannequins look expressive. Meanwhile, the supporting cast, seemingly aware that they are trapped in an irredeemable train wreck, either overact with cartoonish exaggeration or simply give up and mumble their way through their scenes.
Visually, the film is a dumpster fire. The cinematography is an eyesore, featuring inexplicable framing choices, bizarre camera angles, and lighting that either drowns everything in ugly, washed-out brightness or cloaks scenes in murky darkness. The editing is so incompetent that it feels like the work of someone using video software for the first time. Shots linger awkwardly, cuts come at the worst possible moments, and entire sequences seem to be stitched together with all the finesse of a child gluing together a shredded homework assignment.
The special effects? Laughable. The CGI looks like it was pulled from an early-2000s PlayStation 2 cutscene, while practical effects, when used, appear so embarrassingly cheap that they evoke the production values of a high school play. The sound design is equally atrocious, with music that is either completely mismatched to the tone of the scene or so generic that it could be royalty-free stock audio. Sound effects are jarring and misplaced, with gunshots that sound like firecrackers and explosions that seem to have been created using a toaster microphone.
And let's not forget the pacing-or lack thereof. The film drags on for an eternity, stuffing every agonizing minute with filler that serves no purpose. Scenes stretch far beyond their welcome, filled with pointless conversations, redundant flashbacks, and meaningless subplots that lead nowhere. It's as if the director mistakenly thought that longer meant better, completely unaware that the audience is suffering through every agonizing second.
By the time the film reaches its insultingly lazy, rushed, and unsatisfying conclusion, any lingering hope of redemption is crushed. There is no payoff, no catharsis, nothing of value to take away from the experience. The only thing left is an overwhelming sense of regret for having wasted time on something so irredeemably bad.
In short, this movie is a complete and utter failure in every conceivable way. It fails as entertainment, as storytelling, and as filmmaking in general. It is not just bad-it is an assault on cinema itself.",1.0,2025-03-29,14,1,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

The visual effects at times are fine but not jaw-dropping. The acting performances by both Rachel Zegler and Andrew Burnap are top-notch, not going over the top, but 100% believable. The musical numbers 100% hit home, with some performances more likable to see on screen then listening to the soundtrack. Gal Gadot's performance as the Evil Queen occasionally gets 'campy' or over-the top, but then returns to top-notch acting. All in all, this film is truly an underrated gem to simply enjoy and I would highly recommend seeing this film, but once again, if you are looking for a film to sink your teeth into and critique visually, then go watch Jon M. Chu's 'Wicked' or 'Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes'. This film is just simply enjoyable, while bringing breathtaking acting performances by the two lead characters.",7.0,2025-03-22,6,48,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

Marc Webb's direction? If you could fail upwards in filmmaking, this is the masterclass. The movie has no idea what it wants to be. It viciously guts the spirit of the original tale, then stands over the corpse, smugly patting itself on the back for being ""modern."" It's not a reimagining-it's an identity crisis in HD.
The visuals are a joke. The forest looks like a cheap TikTok filter gone rogue. The so-called ""dwarves"" aren't actors-they're CGI nightmares, uncanny and lifeless, who look like they were copied and pasted from three different unfinished Pixar projects. Their musical numbers are physically painful to sit through, awkwardly shoehorned in and completely out of tune with the tone (if there even is one).
Now Rachel Zegler... look, she can sing. That's the one-and only-bright spot in this dumpster fire. Her voice is beautiful. But everything else? Completely falls apart. Her acting is wooden, smug, and emotionless. She delivers her lines like she's reading off cue cards behind the camera, and she carries the role with the energy of someone who doesn't want to be Snow White at all. Her version of the character is about as likable as a tax audit.
And Gal Gadot? Somehow both over-the-top and underwhelming. Her Evil Queen doesn't command the screen-she hijacks it and derails the entire tone of the movie with every eye-roll and overacted sneer.
This film can't find its own identity, yet it bends over backward to distance itself from the original-completely misunderstanding why Snow White is beloved in the first place. It throws away charm, heart, and warmth in exchange for cheap empowerment clichés and a cold, hollow script that lectures more than it entertains.
In short: Snow White (2025) is what happens when a classic story is handed to people who neither understand nor respect it. It's a glitter-coated trainwreck of epic proportions.

Instead of enhancing the story, it strips away everything that made the original special leaving this poisoned apple of a film that is devoid of the life and magic of the original.
The dopey artistic and effects choices made in this version won't make anyone happy, either. There was too much singing and not enough storytelling leading to a rather tedious experience.
While some musical numbers show potential, they are overly produced, which can detract from the authenticity of the performances. Rachel's impressive vocal talent, particularly evident in ""Spellbound,"" illustrates this point. It appears that in some instances, the focus on production has overshadowed the importance of crafting a film that truly connects with audiences.
Additionally, the film appears to fall short of its potential, resembling a production more similar to a made-for-TV movie.

This film started off as a promising premise but completely fell apart due to an inexplicably jarring plot twist and an utterly miscast lead that destroyed what little potential it had.
Let's talk about the plot first. Initially, The Fateful Choice seemed like it was going to be a gripping tale of a young woman struggling with personal demons and having to make a life-altering decision. The premise held promise: the idea of a protagonist being caught between two competing futures-one that could bring them joy, and the other, possibly doom-was ripe for deep emotional exploration. The early scenes set up a compelling narrative, giving us a protagonist that seemed to be facing real, tangible challenges, not just melodramatic hurdles.
But then, somewhere in the middle of the movie, something bizarre happened. The filmmakers decided to throw out the carefully crafted narrative and replace it with an over-the-top, unearned twist that felt completely disconnected from the film's original direction. This twist came out of nowhere and not in a clever, mind-bending way but rather in a ""let's just change everything and see what sticks"" kind of way. Characters made decisions that were out of character, key plot points were dropped without explanation, and any emotional resonance was drowned out by an almost comical turn of events. What was once a grounded drama suddenly became a mess of cheap thrills and nonsensical revelations.
It's a real shame because, for the first half of the film, The Fateful Choice felt like it was building to something meaningful. The cinematography was competent, and there was a subtlety in the way the story was unfolding. But after the plot twist, the movie quickly devolved into something unrecognizable, and not in a way that could be appreciated.

The entire score is really hummable - heigh ho and whistle while you work were great as well as the new waiting on a wish. It was a misstep to not include the gorgeous ""One Song"" from the original - it could have been worked in despite lack of a prince. There are just a lot of things I think were not that bad once I actually saw the film like the backgrounds and costumes. The one big mistake was in not using human actors for the dwarves.

tt6208148,rw10397494,imdbfan-8132657790,Disappointed,"Review: Disney's Snow White (2025) Fails to Capture the Magic

As a lifelong fan of Disney's animated classics, I had high hopes for the latest live-action adaptation of Snow White. With Disney's track record of reimagining its beloved fairy tales, I expected at least a visually stunning and emotionally engaging film. Unfortunately, this Snow White is not just a disappointment-it's a complete misstep. From lackluster performances to uninspired storytelling, this film fails to justify its existence beyond being another forced remake in Disney's recent lineup.

A Story That Forgets Its Own Roots

One of the most glaring issues with this film is how much it distances itself from the 1937 classic. While adaptations don't need to be carbon copies of their predecessors, they should at least retain the spirit of the original. This version, however, seems almost embarrassed by its fairy-tale origins. The changes made to Snow White's character feel forced rather than natural, and they strip away much of what made her endearing. Gone is the sweet and kind-hearted princess who found strength in her kindness. Instead, we get a character so overcorrected that she feels detached from the story's charm.

The Evil Queen, played by Gal Gadot, had the potential to be the film's saving grace, but even her performance is let down by weak writing. She lacks the menacing presence and dramatic flair that made the original Evil Queen such an iconic Disney villain. The film attempts to modernize her motivations, but in doing so, it waters down her menace. A great villain should be both captivating and terrifying, yet Gadot's Queen feels neither.

Where Are the Dwarfs?

Perhaps the most baffling decision of all was the treatment of the Seven Dwarfs. The 1937 film's dwarfs were not just comic relief; they were the emotional heart of the story, providing warmth, humor, and even genuine sadness when Snow White falls under the Queen's spell. In this version, their role is significantly altered, and the result is a film that loses one of its most magical elements. The absence of their classic personalities, comedic timing, and endearing nature leaves a void that no amount of CGI or visual spectacle can fill.

Lackluster Visuals and Forgettable Music

If there was one thing Disney could always be relied on for, it was stunning visuals and memorable music. Yet even in these departments, Snow White falls flat. The CGI feels artificial rather than immersive, making the fantasy world seem lifeless rather than enchanting. The forests, castles, and magical elements should have been dazzling, but instead, they feel like they were generated with minimal effort.

The music, another crucial part of Disney's legacy, is equally underwhelming. While the original film had some of the most iconic Disney songs of all time (Heigh-Ho, Someday My Prince Will Come), this version's soundtrack is utterly forgettable. None of the songs stand out, and the lack of a strong musical presence makes the movie feel lifeless.

A Missed Opportunity

Ultimately, Snow White (2025) feels like a film that doesn't know who it's for. It distances itself too much from the classic for longtime Disney fans to enjoy, yet it lacks the creativity to be a compelling new story for modern audiences. The heart and soul of the original-its whimsy, warmth, and emotional depth-are nowhere to be found. Instead, what we get is a film that seems more focused on checking off corporate mandates than telling a timeless story.

With so many missed opportunities, this Snow White feels like an unnecessary addition to Disney's growing list of uninspired remakes. Rather than breathing new life into a beloved classic, it only serves as a reminder of how magical the original truly was.",1.0,2025-03-23,18,2,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

A complete waste of time and money. Avoid at all costs! They should be ashamed. This isn't Snow White, it's a joke.
As someone who appreciates cinema in its various forms, I went into this new Snow White with an open mind, hoping for a fresh perspective or at least a competent execution of a familiar story. Unfortunately, this film is a profound disappointment on a technical and narrative level.
The direction lacks any discernible vision. The pacing is erratic, lurching from scene to scene without a clear sense of rhythm or purpose. The framing often feels amateurish, with compositions that lack visual interest or thematic resonance. There's a distinct lack of cinematic artistry on display.
The performances are uniformly uninspired. The lead actress, while perhaps given a specific direction, fails to convey any emotional depth or nuance. Her portrayal feels one-note and lacks the necessary complexity to carry the weight of the character. Supporting performances are equally flat and unmemorable.
From a narrative standpoint, the screenplay is a jumbled mess. The attempts at subverting expectations feel forced and lack the necessary groundwork to be truly impactful. The thematic explorations are shallow and underdeveloped, failing to offer any meaningful insights or fresh perspectives on the classic tale. The plot points feel contrived and the overall structure is disjointed.
The visual effects, while present, often feel unintegrated and distract from the storytelling rather than enhancing it. There's a lack of cohesion in the visual style, making the film feel disjointed and lacking a strong aesthetic identity.
Ultimately, this film fails not just as an adaptation, but as a piece of cinema in its own right. It lacks the fundamental elements of good filmmaking: compelling performances, a coherent narrative, and a strong visual language.

Disappointing and Uninspired - A Letdown for Fans
I had high hopes for the new Snow White, but unfortunately, it turned out to be one of the most disappointing adaptations I've seen. The film completely lacks the magic and charm of the original, replacing it with a dull, uninspired story that feels forced rather than heartfelt. The lead performance is underwhelming, and the changes to the classic characters and themes feel unnecessary and, frankly, disrespectful to the beloved source material.

tt6208148,rw10395263,martin-81393,Worst movies so far and I've seen a lot!,"Disney's 2025 live-action remake of Snow White is a catastrophic misstep. This film is a soulless cash grab that desecrates the legacy of the 1937 classic, offering nothing but a hollow shell devoid of charm, innovation, or respect for its source material.

Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White is insipid and lifeless, lacking any semblance of the innocence and grace that defined the original character. Her performance is so devoid of emotion that it renders Snow White a forgettable and uninspiring protagonist. Gal Gadot's turn as the Evil Queen is equally abysmal; her attempt at menace comes off as laughably unconvincing, reducing one of Disney's most iconic villains to a caricature.

The film's visual aesthetic is an affront to the senses. The CGI-rendered dwarfs are grotesque abominations that teeter on the edge of the uncanny valley, making them both unsettling and distracting. The decision to replace the beloved seven dwarfs with these monstrosities is both baffling and offensive, stripping away the heart and soul of the original narrative. The production design is equally atrocious, with sets that resemble cheap, plastic imitations rather than immersive fairy tale landscapes. The entire visual experience is akin to watching a poorly rendered video game cutscene rather than a major cinematic release.

Narratively, the film is a disjointed mess, plagued by misguided attempts at modernizing the story. The inclusion of contemporary themes feels forced and pandering, resulting in a preachy and sanctimonious tone that alienates rather than engages. The screenplay is riddled with clichés and devoid of any original thought, making the 1 hour and 40-minute runtime feel like an eternity.

Musically, the film is a travesty. The new songs are instantly forgettable, lacking the melodic richness and lyrical wit that once defined Disney's musical repertoire. The musical numbers are poorly staged and choreographed, adding nothing to the story and serving only to pad the bloated runtime.

In conclusion, Disney's 2025 Snow White is an unmitigated disaster that should serve as a cautionary tale about the perils of uninspired remakes. It fails on every conceivable level, from performance to visual design to storytelling. This film is not just a disappointment; it is an insult to audiences and a stain on Disney's once-glorious legacy.",1.0,2025-03-22,29,5,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

The film takes a beloved story and drowns it in heavy-handed messaging, clunky dialogue, and a plot that feels like it was stitched together by a committee with no clear vision. The CGI is shockingly subpar-think early 2000s video game cutscenes-and the dwarfs (or whatever they're calling them now) are reduced to forgettable caricatures that add nothing to the story.
Rachel Zegler's Snow White tries hard, but the script gives her little to work with; she oscillates between wooden and overly dramatic without finding a believable middle ground. The songs, which should've been a highlight, are forgettable at best and cringe-inducing at worst- autotune can't save lyrics that sound like they were written by an AI with no soul. The pacing drags, stretching a simple fairy tale into a bloated 2-hour slog that left me checking my watch.

Probably the biggest problem going into the movie is how inconsistent of a filmmaker Marc Webb is and obviously the elephant(s) I the room: Zegler and Gadot.
Zegler has some serious facial acting problems ant times and Gadot is well known as a mediocre actress at best, but Webb was actually able to somewhat hide those issues expertly.
Another really huge problem with Zegler was the fact that she's consider (by most) a worse looking woman than Gadot, but the casting choice was excellent with the direction that the screenplay took and didn't the fact that she's a black actress didn't feel forced at all.
I'm not here to call this a masterpiece, but I'm definitely defending a picture with great technical use of the camera and cgi, surprisingly good enough acting and a screenplay that made me feel like a kid, smiling and being emotional with the story as it progressed and that's what really matters in my opinion when watching these types of movies.",6.0,2025-03-22,7,82,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

tt0029583,rw6175032,snoozejonc,Incredible achievement in 1937,"An evil queen takes out her jealousy on her sweet natured step-daughter Snow White.

There is plenty of information out there telling you how the movie was made so rather than go into detail, I'll just say that it's staggering to think that it was hand drawn by a number of animators who had not done anything of this magnitude before.

Everything about the visuals are absolutely mesmerising when you consider how well it holds up to an audience in the twenty-first century. My daughter has no concept of its age and she reacts the same to the spectacle of Snow White as she does to Frozen.

I can think of so many examples of artistry in the film that I never get tired of watching, so I'll highlight my 3 favourites. Firstly, the reflection and water ripple sequence as Snow White makes her wish at the well. Secondly the brilliant scene as she runs frightened imagining the forrest coming to life and grasping for her. Thirdly all the use of shadow and lightening to create atmosphere in so many different classic scenes.

The plot based on the Brother Grimm fairytale contains a Disney Princess formula much used since. Musical numbers, evil older female antagonist, handsome male love interest, transformation, resurrection, cute animals and comedy relief characters. Disney did this to death in the coming years unfortunately, but not in 1937.

This is a product of its time. Snow White is not a strong character, she embodies the old fashioned sexist ideals that a woman is a homemaker and her sole purpose in life is to find a man. As bad a message as this for young girls to be given by a piece of pop culture, as long as parents compliment this with plenty of positive role models and an explanation of how the world has changed, there is no need to let it spoil the enjoyment.

I have a particularly fond memory of watching this movie with my daughter when she was a three year old looking at the prince kiss Snow White and carry her off to live happily ever after in his castle. I'll never forget her puzzling over what was happening and then asking me if he was Snow White's daddy. In her mind who else could it be?

This film is a soulless, joyless husk of what was once a beloved animated masterpiece. Stripped of all magic and wonder, this film trudges along with all the grace of a corporate spreadsheet-lifeless, uninspired, and designed solely to squeeze more money out of nostalgic audiences while completely disregarding what made the original special.
Let's start with the CGI dwarves, which are nothing short of an abomination. Instead of casting talented little-person actors to bring these iconic characters to life, Disney bowed to the ridiculous and hypocritical opinions of Peter Dinklage, who somehow decided that hiring little people for these roles (the same kinds of roles that have made him rich) is offensive. The result? Awful, weightless CGI creatures that look like they crawled out of a cutscene from a bad 2010s video game.
But of course, what did we expect? This is yet another of Disney's soulless cash grabs, in which they strip-mine their own classics and reduce them to uninspired, pandering disasters. Rather than creating new, compelling stories, they keep regurgitating beloved films, gutting them of heart and sincerity in the process.
And let's not even get started on how this film completely spits in the face of its audience. It takes a timeless fairy tale and mangles it into an ugly, modern, feminist lecture, force-feeding us a misguided and graceless revision of masculinity and femininity. Gone are the classic themes of love, virtue, and kindness, replaced by a clumsy, heavy-handed attempt at empowerment that lacks any charm or authenticity.
Finally, the casting is just laughable. We're seriously expected to believe that Gal Gadot's Evil Queen is jealous of the beauty of Rachel Zegler's Snow White? That's not just a stretch-it's outright comedy. It completely undermines one of the most fundamental aspects of the story. If the audience is too busy laughing at the absurdity of the premise, how are we supposed to be invested in the narrative?
At the end of the day, this film is just another example of Disney's creative bankruptcy. It disrespects its source material, alienates its audience, and fails in every way to justify its own existence.

Negatives
1. It's lifeless and soulless. For a fairytale, it just looked cheap, ugly, and uninspired to look at. Like where did the budget go!
2. The CGI was awful to atrocious. The animals, enviornments and the dwarfs. Everytime the dwarfs were on screen, all I kept thinking was, ""Why not have real dwarfs with makeup in the live action movie!?"" It was so distracting. This movie could've been on Disney Plus or better yet canceled!
3. No real investment or excitement. Everything felt very amateur. The acting, characters and songs lacked energy! It was boring, redundant, and annoying! There's not a single scene that stood out aside from Gal Gadot hamming it up. Don't get me wrong, her acting is still bad in some parts, but i had fun watching her.

First and foremost, the lifeless script is a major issue. The characters lack depth, the dialogues feel artificial, and there's no emotional connection with the audience. Key elements of the fairy tale have been altered, but rather than making the story more engaging, these changes strip it of its essence.
The performances aren't particularly impressive either. Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White lacks charisma and inspiration, making the character feel ordinary and at times even unlikable. Additionally, the characters replacing the seven dwarfs are weakly designed and serve no meaningful purpose in the story.
When it comes to visuals and production quality, the film is shockingly mediocre for a Disney production. The CGI looks cheap, backgrounds feel artificial, and instead of creating a magical atmosphere, the movie ends up looking dull and uninspired.
Ultimately, this film feels like Disney turning its back on its own legacy.

tt6208148,rw10402597,eshahfaisal,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME & MONEY,"Snow White is a painfully outdated and shallow story that drags from start to finish. The plot is wafer-thin, the characters are laughably one-dimensional, and the pacing feels like a slow march through a forest of clichés. Snow White herself lacks agency or depth-her only defining traits are singing, cleaning, and waiting around for a prince she's barely met.

The dwarfs, while mildly entertaining, are reduced to caricatures, and the villain-though iconic-is more style than substance. Worst of all, the film sends questionable messages about beauty, passivity, and love that feel tone-deaf in today's world.

Visually, the animation might have been groundbreaking in 1937, but by modern standards, it feels stiff and lifeless. The songs are forgettable and overplayed, and the entire movie feels like it belongs in a museum-not on a screen.

If you're looking for empowering storytelling or meaningful character development, Snow White is definitely not it. A relic best left in the past.",1.0,2025-03-25,8,0,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

Snow White when held up to today's supposedly superior digital animation, well it may not be as glitzy but it definitely holds it's own especially against something like A Bug's Life (I hate computer animation)...what makes this film hold so well, is the love that can almost be seen in every frame, every tiny movement is a hundred HAND DRAWN animation drawings, hours and hours of work to create a masterpiece that is not really a child's movie.
Today Disney is almost synonymous with childhood, but in the beginning it wasn't the case. Snow White wasn't really made as a kid's movie it was made as a family movie perhaps, but was definitely aimed at a more adult audience (and parts of it are scary for kids) with the peculiarity that it is animated. When you watch Snow White you are watching an art that was almost better in it's infancy that in it's so called adult hood, now there are few hand animators left and instead of sweating over a flip board they are hitting buttons on a computer...and it's missing something somehow.

tt0029583,rw8667433,CinemaClown,"Tiresome, Boring & Tediously Paced","Disney's first foray into feature filmmaking finds the now legendary animation studio scripting history, for Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs was the first full-length traditionally animated film back then and is still counted amongst their crowning achievements. Its creative brushstrokes, simplistic storytelling & childish humour does have a charm to it but this was still a chore to sit through.
Directed by David Hand, the story is based on the German fairy tale of the same name but this adaptation is a tad too simple, sugary sweet & excessively juvenile for my taste. And while I do appreciate the craft behind every frame rendered on screen with care, colours & creativity, the bland storytelling & saccharine execution is just too much to handle sometimes and makes the ride almost unbearable.
Considering what the premise is all about, its 83 mins runtime is rather overlong & spread out to allow the animators to conjure their hand-crafted magic on screen. It is visually arresting at first but the interest begins to fizzle out soon & patience also starts to run thin, for there isn't enough material to keep it afloat and even the gags don't have that amusing quality to them anymore. It is tiresome, boring & tediously paced.
Overall, Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs is no doubt an aesthetic & artistic triumph and can still surprise some newcomers but it nevertheless left me unmoved & unstimulated for the most part just like few other classics of the same era. While there is beauty in its simplicity & innocence on its surface, there is also boredom in its drawn-out narration plus the film hasn't aged well either.

Walt Disney I appreciate your work but I don't of this princess.
The first time when I saw the movie was only for fun and use the time in something with only 8 years old but later in the second and third time. I see it boring, with uncomfortable feeling about snow white, her voice and empty attitudes.
I try it again, 6 days before of today but I still with the same feeling of isn't a good story for me.
I just forget about the existence of Snow White with her movie later of a year. And ago 4 week appear again like a surprise.
My perspective about the movie is:
Extra characters: Creative and little nice
Character Snow White: I found her so soft for my like since the beginning, is like a doll but in a part of the movie she become rare and nothing for comfortable.
Music: Sound strange for the time but still feeling a little alive. The music save this movie.
Style: Curious but colorful, dresses, hair and accessories perfect for a kid.
Story: I always had the feeling of empty parts or out of logic and I still feeling it like that way.
In resume, is a good Fairy tale when you are kid but maybe I was a something different and not a kid. The story have romance, adventures and magic for only kids likes.
I recommend the movie in case of you like tale's of a princess and a prince with romance. Only of that way you gonna to stay happy.
It's a little story for days and forget it a month later, nothing special at all, work for use the time without watching the screen.

tt0029583,rw0017059,tvking1285,"Great at times, but not the perfect Disney cartoon","Yes, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" was the first full-length animated feature and yes, it does look tecnically beautiful, but I feel that it isn't the best Disney film (that honer goes to ""sleeping Beauty""). There are reasons why I don't like it a lot (Spoilers might be coming).

First off, the queen (voiced by Lucille LaVerne) is one scary villian. Scary enough to even scare the s*** off a grown-up. The queen's transformation is still one of the scariest scenes I have ever seen in a animated film. When the queen is around, the movie turns into a dark fantasy and it overshadows the child-like elements of the film.

But the scene I hated the most was the ""Heigh-Ho"" sequence. For me, the scene just didn't do it for me. It is a scene that seems more like it overplays itself. This scene could have been two other things. We could have just heard them talking or they could have gotten rid of the scene altogether and used the deleted ""Music In Your Soup"" number. For almost eleven years, I was scared of this scene until I saw ""Gremlins"" recently where they used this scene. I wasn't afraid anymore, but I was unmoved by the scene.

But I did say it was great at times and it is. This is mainly evident in the film's conclusion. It's conclusion is well thought out and in the end, it pays off big time and it shows. I wasn't even disturbed by the title-card narration. I actully thought it was quite inventive , but the title-card narration was actully animated and it was not used for almost the same reason the ""Music In Your Soup"" sequence was deleted. Due to time. Walt Disney himself said in 1955 on his television show that it was cut due to this very reason

There was only one scary sequence I liked and it was when Snow White went in to the forest. Another good sequence involves the dwarfs washing up. It is very funny and interesting. The climatic chase sequence between the Queen and the dwarfs is easily the film's best scene and the scene where the queen poisons Snow White with the apple is made great by its trick photography.

In the end, I have mixed feelings about the film. Some scenes are great while others fall flat on their face (like the ""Heigh-Ho"" sequence), but under its many flaws, it is still a very good film, but its not the greatest of them all. I might be 15 years old, but I like the film anyway.

But it still gets a good rating from me *** out of ***** or 6/10",,2001-07-02,0,5,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

This film, along with Bambi, exhibit some fantastic watercolor-type artwork with the latter being ever more spectacular than this one.
The story is ""cute"" because of the seven dwarfs. The evil character - the queen - doesn't have that big a role so most of the time it's just a sweet, enjoyable film with nice characters. It's one of the those movies that makes you feel good as you are watching it.

tt0029583,rw0017116,Smells_Like_Cheese,"And then there was Disney,,,","Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the very first animated film featured by Disney and one of the most charming. While it's a bit different from the original fairy tale, Walt Disney took this familiar classic and turned into a family film that is still talked about over 60 years later. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is such a charming film and is another example of beautiful animation and a terrific story that could charm it's way into your heart. I still enjoy watching this film to this day, who could love the seven dwarfs? They all were so funny to watch and are so memorable. They pretty much represent our moods, they're kinda like a mood ring that's put into one room, lol. But Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the perfect family film that is still holding up very well all these years.
Snow White is a lovely princess who one day is just traveling through the forest. She comes across a house where it's a total mess, she decides to clean it as a favor to those who are living there. It turns out that seven dwarfs live there and when they find her, they realize they got a good thing going here, a hot girl who'll clean for them. But not everything is happy, the evil wicked queen wants to be the fairest in the land and Snow White has just beat her by a land slide. So she disguises herself as a witch and offers Snow White an apple, she eats it, and dies. Now the queen's the hottest girl in town, but the dwarfs come up with a clever plan to get her true love, the prince, he must kill the queen and save Snow White so they could live happily ever after.
I'd say that's a nice summary, I try my best anyways. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is just one of the greatest Disney films ever made. It's such a charming film and is very much apart of our pop culture today and as far as films go, this is just a great one. I can't wait to show this to my kids one day, they'll probably laugh thinking how old this movie is that it's hand drawn, but I think that's what makes it so special. The voices, the songs, the animation, everything about Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was just beautiful. I highly recommend this, it's a great family film.

tt0029583,rw0017115,travisimo,A Movie Milestone,"Where would the animation world be without the humongous success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?  If the movie failed back in 1937, there would be no Disney Company today, no Lion King, and no Disneyland.  Disney's Folly, as critics first called it, would probably have scared any other industry from attempting such an ambitious and innovative project.  Pixar may not have ever had the chance to put out their groundbreaking features, and even the Disney- and fairy tale-bashing Shrek may never have been made if Snow White didn't set the course for the world of the animated feature.
There must have been tremendous pressure on everyone involved in the making of Snow White, but they did not disappoint.  The end result includes a timeless story, classic songs, and beautiful imagery that will live on for future generations to enjoy.  In fact, this was only the second movie that captured my nieces' full attention spans (The Lion King being the first).
In my opinion, the story was great but not perfect.  It's not as exciting or filled with as much witty remarks as today's animated features, but as soon as the dwarfs are introduced, the movie takes on an endearing lighter side. For the record, my favorite dwarf is Doc, because I can relate to him being a strong leader with some very humanistic follies, such as always getting tongue-tied (I do that myself all too often).  All the songs stand out in their own way.  `Some Day My Prince Will Come' is a classic, fairy-tale ballad.  `Heigh-Ho,' `Dig, Dig, Dig,' and `Whistle While You Work' are great songs to pick up your spirits when you have to go to work, do chores, or do homework.  And my favorite, `The Silly Song,' is just a great, catchy, and funny song.  As for the imagery, it's just breathtaking, especially considering how early it was introduced.  The colors are rich and lively, and the multi-plane camera does add some great depth to the movie.
As you can tell, for an animation and Disney fan like myself, Snow White is a perfect milestone in the movie world.  Even compared to the animation and storytelling styles of today, Snow White still stands the test of time. Kudos to everyone involved in this picture as their work will live on forever.

tt0029583,rw0017060,Doylenf,Still one of the all-time great animated classics...,"My mother kept an old clipping for years describing SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS when it opened at Radio City Music Hall and received a rave review from newspaper columnist Westbrook Pegler.
He usually wrote about politics but on this occasion he took time to devote an entire review to Disney's new film. He called it a ""masterpiece"" and said that when the projectionist slipped those reels of film on the projector, the audience at the Music Hall witnessed one of the greatest motion pictures ever made.
Coming from him, that was high praise indeed. And seeing the film now, restored for its video bow, we can appreciate his words. There are faults, to be sure, but basically it has to be admired for the innovative techniques it used in the art of animation. There are memorable sequences thanks to daring use of the multiplane camera: Snow White's flight through the woods, the Queen and her Magic Mirror, the Queen in the thunderous transformation scene as the camera seems to whirl around her, the Dwarfs in the mine and their march over the bridge as they sing ""Heigh-Ho"", the dwarfs chasing the witch in the thunderstorm. Even the rippling effects of the water in the wishing well scene.
And, of course, there are the genuinely comic moments that made even the great Charlie Chaplin applaud in admiration. Dopey's antics are always a delight, as are Doc's and Grumpy's. All of the dwarfs are given inventive and funny things to do.
The music is a standout: Someday My Prince Will Come, Heigh-Ho, I'm Wishing, The Yodel Song, etc. The young in heart will always love this classic. It belongs in the top tier of Disney's crown jewels, along with Pinocchio, Bambi, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella.

Indeed, at the time, it was the very first full length animated feature, a huge gamble for Walt Disney, but this gamble paid off as it was a big box-office it and it started the massive empire of Disney in the film business. Eventually, this movie would become the blueprint for their future work and, after all years, the timeless fairy tales are still their most enduring trademark. Fortunately, they have the financial means to maintain their work and this movie has been restored already a couple of times and it looks quite amazing. Of course, they would improve and/or diversify their technique through the years but this one was already quite gorgeous to look at. To be honest, even though the story was charming and the dwarfs pretty hilarious, the plot was decent but not really strong, in my opinion. For example, they spent half of the running time with Snow White getting to their home and getting acquainted with those fellows while everything involving the prince was seriously underwritten. Indeed, nowadays, this whole concept of this prince coming up from nowhere and basically saving the day seems rather hard to swallow for the modern audience (see 'Frozen' and 'Maleficent', also both Disney productions).

tt0029583,rw2936982,GamerOfTime,The first of many Disney classics,"Disney's ""Snow White"" was the very first full length animated film and without it, we most likely would have never had the classics that came years after.

Snow White lives in a castle with her stepmother who is jealous of her stepdaughter's beauty and wishes to kill her so she will become ""the fairest of them all."" Snow White runs away into the forest and comes across the cottage of the seven Dwarfs and they agree to let her stay but the Queen decides to take care of Snow White herself upon discovering that she is still alive and living with the seven dwarfs.

For starters, the animation is fantastic and you can only imagine how long it must have taken the animators to draw out one frame alone. The studio was also used to animating characters in a silly style like Mickey Mouse at the time and the training they went through shows how determined Walt Disney was to make this film happen especially considering he put a mortgage on his house to get the money to make the film and would have ended up homeless if it failed.

The voice cast is also fantastic, especially upon learning that this was Adrianna Caselotti's first role in a motion picture. Most modern Disney fans criticise her voice for Snow White and label it ""annoying"" but I feel the voice fits the character perfectly since Snow White is 14 years old in the film. Lucille La Verne is also great as the Queen and captures the wicked nature of her cruel intentions perfectly.

Many also complain about the changes from the source material despite the fact that not everything from a book can be adapted into a film. I feel that making Snow White 14 in the film instead of 7 like in the original tale was a better choice as seeing a child go through certain events in the film such as the forest scene may have been traumatising.

Overall, this is one of the studios best animated features with impressive animation, a great cast of voices and is the reason why we have the classics we know and love today.",10.0,2014-01-07,19,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

I had seen it several times as a child, but my memory of certain details had faded. I think it's a good film, or rather, a short film. Essentially, it's a small story about a witch, Snow White, and the seven dwarfs. It's an innocent animation, with no malice-perhaps a bit reflective of its time. Of course, it was one of Disney's earliest animated films, made in 1937.
The animation is quite impressive; I especially liked the scene where the witch tries to throw the boulder at the dwarfs at the end. Overall, the animation is charming and the story isn't particularly complex or developed, given the film's short length of just over an hour.

tt0029583,rw0017102,laffinsal,The Queen Rules,"Quite simply, this one reigns supreme. Although much of the praise this film receives, may be due to the fact that it was it's creator's first attempt at an animated feature, I think it's obvious merits and artistic triumphs are enough to maintain it's place at the top.
First, there is the artwork, which is stunning. The color isn't at it's most vibrant, such as with, say, ""Cinderella"" (1950), but it is suitable and lovely all the same. A virtual watercolor painting come to life. The details in the animation never fail to amaze. Just look at the raindrops in the chase sequence towards the end. Look how they hit the rocks, and slip away. Such attention to detail was rarely matched in an animated feature, except maybe, in ""Pinocchio"" (1940).
The characters are of various degrees of interest, with Snow White, probably the least of these. The dwarfs are all charming, and it is they who carry the film during their screentime with the princess. However, one should not deny, that the true star of this film, is the evil queen. Both in her presence of glamour, and in her transformation as an old crone, she is fascinating to watch. I don't believe another Disney villian has ever been both frightening and enchanting, like she has.
Lastly, the music in this film is truly memorable. The ""Heigh Ho"" sequence is visually impressive, and the dwarfs song as they bathe is a great comedy bit. Not to mention Snow White's anthem ""Someday My Prince Will Come""; another gem in the Disney library.
All in all, a tremendous production. Beautiful, thrilling, and memorable.",,2002-12-12,79,8,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0
tt0029583,rw2606787,hall895,Disney's triumph,"Derided as Disney's Folly during its production Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs would turn out to be Disney's greatest triumph. How different the world would be had Walt Disney failed with Snow White. This was the first full-length animated feature. If it did not succeed there wouldn't be any others. At least not for a very, very long time. No Pinocchio, no Bambi, all the way up to probably no Toy Story. Because if Snow White failed there would be no Disney as we know it. And if there's no Disney the history of film, animation and all of entertainment is quite different. So much of what we have known and embraced all these decades goes back to a fairy tale princess and seven of her closest, shortest friends.
Considering an animation project of this magnitude had never been undertaken it is quite remarkable just how magnificent this film looks. The colors pop, the backgrounds are fabulous, the attention to detail is tremendous. The dwarfs look absolutely terrific. Brilliant character design executed wondrously by Disney's team of animators. The personality of each dwarf shines through before any of them even speak, the visuals are so good they tell each character's story perfectly. The animals, and this film's got plenty of animals, all look great. The villainous queen, in both her incarnations, is a sight to behold. Oddly, perhaps the least visually appealing thing in the whole film is Snow White herself. She's really not all that much to look at. A flat, almost featureless face. She's an iconic film character, Disney's most famous and beloved princess. But truth is she's a bit of a plain Jane. Fairest of them all? In this case the visual doesn't quite sell that story. And her prince is a bit of a dud too. But as a whole the art and animation on display here is quite terrific, and considering the laborious process by which it was created, a little miraculous.
Could the world truly be captivated by a cartoon? In 1937 most people didn't think so. A five-minute short, that's one thing. An 83-minute feature? No way a cartoon could hold the attention for that long. Wrong. Admittedly there are times when the film's story does drag. Some sequences do nothing to advance the plot, they just pad the running time to an acceptable feature length. Snow White herself is not a particularly interesting character so the film doesn't really kick into high gear until the dwarfs are introduced. They give the film its personality. They give the film a song you'll be humming for hours after the film ends. They gave the film its humor but also gave it its emotional heart. The bond they form with Snow White is what allows the film's ending to pack such an emotional wallop. Yes, a cartoon can provoke genuine, heartfelt feeling. As it is that ending may be a bit rushed. The story wraps itself up and it's The End before you know what hit you. When it's over you can look back and see there is so much to appreciate. Walt Disney gambled big and won. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is not a perfect film, some parts work better than others. But there is no denying it was a magnificent achievement for its time. It is still thoroughly enjoyable all these years later. And it is well worth its iconic place in film history.",7.0,2012-05-04,7,1,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

What makes Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs so beloved, even nearly a century later, is its emphasis on the fundamental principles that defined Walt Disney's vision: beauty, goodness, and an unwavering belief in happily ever afters. The film exudes a warmth and sincerity that is rare in modern cinema. Snow White herself embodies a gentle spirit, one that faces hardship with grace and perseverance. She does not allow cruelty or misfortune to harden her heart. Instead, she chooses kindness, treating even the most unexpected friends-the seven dwarfs-with the same warmth and generosity she would show to a noble prince.
The dwarfs, too, represent timeless values. Each of them, despite their quirks and unique personalities, showcases loyalty, devotion, and a strong moral compass. They take Snow White in without hesitation, demonstrating a selflessness that speaks to the very heart of the film. Even in its moments of peril, when the Evil Queen's jealousy and malice cast a dark shadow over Snow White's innocent world, the film does not linger on despair. Instead, it reminds us that goodness will always prevail over evil, and that love-be it romantic love, friendship, or familial love-has the power to overcome even the darkest of curses.
In many ways, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a reflection of an era when storytelling prioritized virtue over cynicism. It invites viewers into a world where love triumphs over hate, where hard work is rewarded, and where beauty is as much about kindness as it is about outward appearance. These themes have resonated with generations, making the film not just a piece of entertainment, but a cherished part of childhood for millions around the world.
It is precisely because of this deep, nostalgic connection to the original film that the upcoming Snow White remake has been met with skepticism and concern. Disney, once synonymous with upholding traditional values while introducing them to new audiences, seems determined to dismantle the very heart of what made the original so special. Instead of preserving the timeless themes of kindness, virtue, and love, the remake appears to be more focused on rewriting the past, erasing the essence of Walt Disney's vision rather than celebrating it.
While evolution in storytelling is natural, there is something to be said for respecting the integrity of a classic. The original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was never just a fairy tale-it was a promise to audiences that magic still exists in the world, that beauty and kindness are worth aspiring to, and that there is power in hope. To strip the story of its fundamental principles is to strip it of its very soul.
What remains to be seen is whether modern audiences, especially younger generations, will continue to appreciate the magic of the original. With its enchanting animation, unforgettable characters, and music that still brings a tear to the eye, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is more than just a film-it is a legacy. One that, no matter how many remakes come and go, will always shine brighter than any attempt to redefine it.",10.0,2025-03-27,11,0,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

tt0029583,rw2174255,tavm,"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, while not great, is still a pretty good Disney animated feature","After watching the recent Disney animated feature-The Princess and the Frog-I decided to finally see the recent DVD I bought of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs-Uncle Walt's first attempt at a full-length cartoon-for the first time ever. Now, despite the bland characterization of the Prince-not to mention his stiff drawn movements which caused the animators to reduce his role-and the female title character only marginally better personality-wise, this is still a very entertaining initial attempt at an animated feature from the Disney studio. That's largely due to the way each of the Seven Dwarfs become charmingly charismatic in their personalities due to both movements and voices. I mean, Dopey is the perfect Harpo-like character with the way he communicates without saying a word (though we do hear him express shock and sadness when those moments appear, courtesy of Eddie Collins). Also perfect are the characterizations of Sneezy-with Laurel & Hardy player Billy Gilbert doing his iconic sneeze-and Grumpy-with Goofy creator Pinto Colvig giving his grouch a touch of likability that makes one identify with him. And Lucille La Verne is just suitably atmospheric voicing both the mean Queen stepmother of White and that Queen's later change to the Witch. While Ms. White is not a vibrant personality, she still has some naive charm that makes it understandable why the Dwarfs, even eventually Grumpy, fall for her. That's all due to her voice of Adriana Caselotti when she's both singing and speaking. It's too bad Mr. Disney didn't allow her to do any further outside work (though it's nice to know her voice can be heard in both 1939's The Wizard of Oz-as part of the Tin Man's thought-and my favorite film of It's a Wonderful Life-as a singer in the Martini's Bar sequence). Many classic sequences include the ""Heigh Ho"" number, Grumpy's bath, the Queen's transformation, and the chase sequence involving the Dwarfs, the forest animals, and the Witch Queen's attempted escape. So on that note, while I don't think this movie is one of the best animated features-Disney or otherwise-ever, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is still pretty compelling as such things go. P.S. The Prince's singing and speaking voice is that of one Harry Stockwell, father of child and adult actor Dean Stockwell.",7.0,2009-12-14,4,3,2025-04-11 12:46:58,0

Snow White will undoubtedly be solidified as one of the best, if not the best Disney live-action films, one that somehow managed the rare feat of surpassing its original version. Rachel Zegler was perfectly cast as the titular character, and Gal Gadot's scene-stealing performance as the Evil Queen is delightful.

This new Snow White lacks much-no soul, no vision, just the hollow echoes of zeitgeist-driven whims. But to be fair, rewriting and retelling old fairy tales is nothing new. The original stories are often far too dark and cruel for children, at least for the modern era. Many of the tales we know today are softened versions of the originals collected and recorded by the Brothers Grimm. In that sense, most of Disney's and Hollywood's adaptations have never been entirely faithful to their source material.
That said, this latest disneyfied version is particularly cringe-worthy in its forced ""zeitgeist improvements"" and, in my opinion (I like to repeat myself here), lacks any real soul - just like so many productions these days. In short: bad to mediocre storytelling and character-development, too much agenda (at least for my taste).

tt6208148,rw10394798,andywheeler-11072,Honest thoughts. I liked it.,"My honest thoughts on Snow White and just to clarify, Disney hasn't paid me to write something nice.
Disney's live-action remake of Snow White has been one of the most talked-about-and often unjustly maligned-films online. Despite the polarised critics and the relentless hate campaign, I firmly believe this film is pure Disney magic.
What truly stood out was how the story was adjusted for a slightly modern take. The film not only answers lingering questions about Snow White's skin color and the origin of her name but does so with a refreshing narrative twist that feels both authentic and engaging.
Rachel Zegglar delivers a brilliant performance that perfectly captures the quintessential Disney voice. She brings a captivating charm to the role, embodying the magic and wonder that the character deserves.
One of the main concerns leading up to the film was the CGI portrayal of the dwarfs. I was pleasantly surprised-these digital characters were executed flawlessly, preserving the charm of their animated counterparts. Their scenes in the diamond mine, in particular, looked stunning on screen, and I couldn't imagine them being any better served by human actors.
The musical numbers hit many high notes as well. I loved the classic ""Hi Ho"" and ""Whistle While You Work,"" and the new song ""Wishing on a Wish"" was nicely done. While not every song hit the mark, the soundtrack overall enriched the fairytale atmosphere of the film.
Gal Gadot's performance, while occasionally a bit over-the-top, ultimately worked well-especially in her portrayal of the old witch with the poison apple. Even though some moments felt slightly exaggerated, her energy added an interesting dynamic to the film.
Compared to other live-action remakes like Wicked, which certainly had its moments, this version of Snow White stands out as my favorite Disney live-action adaptation so far. It exudes a pure fairytale feel that pays homage to the original animation while embracing a modern sensibility. The film might not have the grand scale of Wicked, but its charm, humor, and heart make it a delightful experience. The kids in the cinema laughed at key moments and all seemed be saying they enjoyed it leaving the cinema. My grandson, Charlie, loved it.
I wholeheartedly recommend taking your kids to see it. They'll love it, and so will you.

-she has a great voice
-i personaly think she looks good, i know many think she's ugly but i dont see it i think she looks great.
-she is decent actor. Not good but decent.

-she cannot sing, her songs were autotune a lot.
-her acting is very flat as the evil queen it's not her best role.
Good:

Yea they could do a lot more with Lana Parila (the one that playd the evil queen in once upon a time)
and with Jenna Ortega (wensday from the adams family 'wensday' series on netflix) as snow white.
They could add some comedy to the evil queen
not kept it so boring

disney never talks to the fans..
they could have made this a 12/10 movie
instead they made this
which is not bad
it's def not a 1/10 movie
but it's a great 6/10 movie
and you know what ?

tt6208148,rw10416750,imdbfan-3157206342,Never again,"The new Snow White film has sparked quite a bit of conversation, but unfortunately, my experience with it was far from positive. As a long-time fan of the classic fairy tale, I had high hopes for this adaptation, expecting a fresh take on a beloved story. However, I was left disappointed by the overall execution, particularly the performances and the direction.
First and foremost, the casting of the lead character, Snow White, was a major letdown. The actress chosen for the role failed to bring the charm and depth that the character demands. Instead of embodying the innocence and resilience that define Snow White, her performance felt flat and uninspired. Throughout the film, I found myself struggling to connect with her character. The emotional range was lacking, and key moments that should have evoked sympathy or excitement fell completely flat. It seemed as though she was merely going through the motions rather than genuinely inhabiting the role.
Moreover, the supporting cast did little to elevate the film. Characters that should have been vibrant and engaging were reduced to one-dimensional caricatures. The dwarfs, who play an essential role in the story, were particularly disappointing. Instead of being portrayed as unique individuals with distinct personalities, they felt like generic sidekicks, lacking the wit and charm that made them memorable in previous adaptations. The chemistry between the characters was almost nonexistent, making it difficult to invest in their relationships or care about their fates.
The script also left much to be desired. The dialogue was often cringe-worthy, with lines that felt forced and unnatural. It seemed as though the writers were trying too hard to update the story for a modern audience, but the attempts at humor and relevance fell flat. There were moments that should have been poignant or magical, but instead, they came across as awkward and contrived. The pacing of the film was uneven, leading to a disjointed narrative that failed to maintain engagement. At times, I found myself checking the time, eager for the film to reach its conclusion.
Visually, while the film had its moments of beauty, the overall aesthetic felt inconsistent. The cinematography lacked the enchanting quality that one would expect from a fairy tale. Some scenes were visually stunning, showcasing lush landscapes and vibrant colors, but others felt dull and uninspired. The special effects, which should have added to the magic of the story, often appeared cheap and unconvincing. Instead of immersing the audience in a fantastical world, it felt more like a low-budget production that failed to deliver on its promises.
Additionally, the direction of the film was questionable at best. The pacing was erratic, with some scenes dragging on while others felt rushed. It was as if the director was unsure of how to balance the various elements of the story, leading to a final product that felt disjointed and lacking cohesion. Key moments that should have been climactic were underwhelming, leaving the audience with a sense of dissatisfaction rather than fulfillment.
In conclusion, the new Snow White film failed to live up to the legacy of its predecessors. With a lackluster performance from the lead actress, a weak script, and inconsistent direction, it struggled to capture the magic and charm of the original tale. As a viewer, I left the theater feeling disappointed and unfulfilled, wishing for a film that could do justice to the beloved character of Snow White. Unfortunately, this adaptation missed the mark on almost every level, leaving it as one of the more forgettable entries in the fairy tale genre.

Instead of honoring the timeless charm of the original, this film strips away everything that made it special, replacing it with forced modern messaging, lackluster performances, and a complete misunderstanding of its own source material.
First, let's talk about the obvious-this was never a movie that needed a remake. The original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) is a classic that set the foundation for Disney's golden age of animation. It was beautifully animated, had iconic music, and, most importantly, heart. This version, on the other hand, is a bland, CGI-heavy mess with none of the magic.
The casting choices and script changes feel more like a marketing stunt than an attempt to tell a good story. The removal of key elements (like the dwarfs) and the rewriting of Snow White's character into something completely unrecognizable only further prove that the filmmakers had no real interest in staying true to the fairy tale. Instead of an innocent, kind-hearted princess, we now get a modernized, independent warrior who looks down on the original story. And let's be honest-if you don't respect the source material, why even bother remaking it?
The visuals are another disappointment. Despite Disney's massive budget, the CGI looks lifeless, and the costume designs are forgettable at best. The film lacks the handcrafted beauty of the animated original and instead feels like yet another generic, over-processed live-action attempt that no one really asked for.
Disney used to be about storytelling. Now, it's about ticking boxes and making headlines. This movie isn't about nostalgia or bringing a classic to a new generation-it's about using a beloved brand to push a half-baked modern narrative while cashing in on a known IP.
At the end of the day, this Snow White remake is unnecessary, uninspired, and utterly forgettable. If you love the original, do yourself a favor-skip this movie and rewatch the 1937 masterpiece instead.",1.0,2025-03-23,13,1,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

The only reason I'm writing a review is because I know there's going to be a ton a negativity here so trying to show the other side.
The beginning was a bit of a slog to get through; it was pretty sugary. Yes we know she had a wonderful family and everyone loved everyone else and then Mom died and Dad picked a terrible second wife. Blah blah blah
But for all those rumors swirling about how Snow doesn't need a Prince apparently that didn't mean they weren't going to give us a male hero...in this iteration he's more or less a Robin Hood kind of guy. Kind of vanilla but it's a princess movie, right ?
The dwarves were a LOT to get past but you do actually get used to the weird CGI (not quite as creepy as the Polar Express)
and they play their parts well enough.
Ludicrous that Disney used CGI for the Seven Dwarves and then in the next bit of the film there is an actual little person (can't say dwarf or Peter Dinklage will get mad🙄) who gets more character development than any of the Seven do.
Snow herself is very sweet but I can see for kids she would have her charm. The Evil Queen is a scenery chewing Gal Gadot, channeling her inner Joan Crawford in an interesting flip from her usual heroic roles. (be prepared --- she sings!! Very trashy and lots of fun)
There's a lot of echoes from other films here, but as someone who has seen the original on the big screen (in a rerelease back in the 70s) and loved it for decades I can say this version is quite enjoyable. Was it necessary? No
Is it vintage Disney? No
Did it come out too close to Wicked? Yes!!!
Will you like it?
I don't know.

tt6208148,rw10430477,hasek-01064,Pretentious,"Disney's Snow White is less a fairy tale and more a pretentious lecture wrapped in bad CGI and empty virtue signaling. It strips away the charm, warmth, and soul of the original and replaces it with a self-important mess that thinks it's profound for rewriting a story that didn't need fixing. Snow White herself is no longer a kind-hearted heroine but a smug, personality-free ""girlboss"" dropped into a plot that barely resembles the original. The Evil Queen? More like a bored actress reading lines from a Tumblr thread.
Visually, the film is a dumpster fire. The CGI is so jarringly bad it makes Shrek look like a documentary. The forest looks fake, the creatures look worse, and the ""seven dwarfs"" are such a bizarre, uncanny abomination they could double as horror villains. It's a film so desperate to be modern and ""empowering"" that it forgot to be magical, coherent, or even remotely entertaining.

The emotional depth that made the original so compelling is largely absent, making it difficult to connect with the characters on any level. One of the most jarring aspects of this adaptation is the CGI dwarves, which are not only unsettling but outright terrifying. Their artificial, almost uncanny appearance makes them difficult to take seriously and significantly detracts from the overall viewing experience. Instead of enhancing the story, the CGI feels out of place and distracting, pulling focus away from the narrative and breaking immersion at key moments. The decision to use CGI in this way ultimately does a disservice to the film, making it feel more like an animated feature than a live-action adaptation. What made the original so special was its charm, warmth, and the authenticity of its characters, but much of that has been stripped away in favor of a visually flashy but emotionally hollow experience. The heart of the story seems to have been lost in the process, replaced with a cold, artificial aesthetic that fails to capture the magic and wonder of the original.

As for the Queen, she's just beautiful-there's no real menace in her performance. The dwarfs are cute, though. The storyline mostly follows the original, just without the prince.

tt6208148,rw10405159,imdbfan-5286909406,Horrible Movie,"Disney's latest attempt to ""reimagine"" a classic fairytale, Snow White (2024), is less of a magical adventure and more of a misguided slog through a forest of bad decisions. If you were hoping for a film that honors the charm and wonder of the 1937 original, prepare for disappointment-because this movie throws all of that into a wishing well and hopes no one notices. The script tries so hard to be modern and ""empowered"" that it forgets to be entertaining. Snow White is rebranded as an independent, warrior-like heroine, which wouldn't be a bad thing if it weren't done at the expense of the character's warmth, kindness, and, well... actual character. Instead of a heartfelt journey, we get a generic, lifeless protagonist who delivers her lines like she's reading an inspirational Instagram caption.

The Evil Queen, usually one of Disney's most iconic villains, is reduced to a shallow, CGI-heavy mess with motivations that feel more like an afterthought than a genuine threat. And don't even get me started on the lack of actual dwarfs. Instead, we get a bizarre collection of CGI-generated sidekicks that feel like they belong in a rejected Lord of the Rings spinoff. While Disney is known for its breathtaking animation and production design, this film manages to make even its lavish sets feel lifeless. The excessive use of CGI sucks out any real magic, leaving the world feeling artificial and cold.

This is a live action, musical adaptation of the 1937 animated classic, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Rachel plays Snow White, growing up with the King and Queen as her parents, teaching her how to become a nice and selfless Princess. After her mother dies, the beautiful-and quite evil-Gal shows up and charms the King into marrying her and it's not long before she sends the King off to his death leaving her in charge. Gal has a mirror that she consults with about who is the fairest in the land, which is usually Gal herself, of course. That is , until Snow gets older and then the mirror changes it's tune. Gal tries to get rid of Rachel but she is saved, first by the Seven Dwarfs-CGI is used for them-and then by a band of outlaws led by Andrew. Like I said earlier, it is a musical but between the songs, there are the familiar elements of the story, such as the cruel and evil Gal and her poisoned apple and then the forest animals flocking around all lovey dovey around Rachel.

It's rated PG for violence, peril and rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes.

Rachel Zegler is nonetheless talented and charming, and plays a completely convincing Snow White, especially in the scenes synchronized with the original masterpiece. So why did she allow herself to be drawn into the controversy surrounding the film's release, particularly by blaming Disney executives?

However, the following aspects do not do justice to the talent of the two main actresses:

The storyline, which falls apart as soon as it deviates from the original plot, particularly with completely unrealistic historical aspects of medieval Europe,


The rest of the cast, which simply doesn't live up to Gal Gadot or Rachel Zegler. Prince Charming, for example, seriously lacks the substance and depth to be even remotely believable, both in terms of acting and costumes.


The crudely computer-generated dwarves, who seem to have come straight out of the first historical attempts at this genre. Why was ""Willow"" (1988) so successful with real dwarves forty years ago?

I went into the Snow White remake with low expectations, but somehow it still managed to fall short. From start to finish, the film is a masterclass in how not to reimagine a classic.
The acting? Painfully wooden. Not a single performance felt genuine or emotionally engaging. The cast seemed either wildly miscast or simply uninterested in the material. There was no chemistry, no spark-just awkward line delivery and forced expressions.
As for the storyline, it was a muddled mess. Gone is the charm and magic of the original fairytale. What we're left with is a plot that drags, meanders, and ultimately goes nowhere. It feels like the writers tried to modernize the tale without actually understanding what made the original so beloved in the first place.
Visually, it's dull. Tonally, it's confused. And most importantly, it's just plain boring. There's no sense of wonder, no real stakes, and certainly nothing that justifies sitting through the entire runtime.

I've been aching to see this from when I found out it was being made and I enjoyed it more than I expected.

I loved how the ""prince"" character had more involvement and the development of him and snow white getting to know each other. I loved how he was thrown in the dungeon as this was walt Disney's original intent but of course his involvement was cut down in the animation because it was much harder to animate a male character at that time. The dungeon idea was eventually used in sleeping beauty.

Rachel zegler as snow white is not walt Disney's snow white but she is a modern day Snow White. I thought she was a good role model standing up for what is fair and right. I loved how they developed the love story but I thought it was a real shame they didn't include someday my prince will come as it is such an iconic song which echoes love and hope. They're is nothing wrong in hoping to find someone you love and be happy with.

I loved the scene were she runs though the forest it was so scary but magical too.

I was a little disappointed with gal gadot as the queen. I thought the costumes were amazing and echoed the original but I feel the transformation scene was rushed and a bit underwhelming. This was such an iconic scene from the original and I think they could of done so much with it. The old hag was good but I thought she could of been much scarier. I also thought her song was pointless.

What I enjoyed the most and that surprised me was the dwarfs they were all so cute and funny and had real personalities I loved dopey the most and I loved what they did with him. The cottage too was just like in the animation it looked so magical.

I feel like they tried to make this into a sort of Broadway musical and I didn't think the new songs were needed.

I'd give this an overall 6 out of 10 i did enjoy it and I think it's definitely worth going to see in the cinema as it looks magical and it has a good message for modern audiences but it's definitely not walt disneys version.

I've watched many versions of snow white but my favourite live action version is the hallmark one from 2001. It is faithful to the grimms version and it shows the 3 times the queen comes to try kill snow white. I absolutely love the queen in that one too.

So if you love snow white and Disney I would see it but don't expect to see something close to the original film or fairy tale as this is definitely it's own thing and its another version of the snow white tale.",6.0,2025-03-25,15,214,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

tt6208148,rw10407540,ian-47918,Fairest of Them All? Not Quite.,"By Ian Chandler - March 25, 2025
The 2025 remake of Disney's Snow White is unnecessary, but does it have to be rated as low as Manos: The Hands of Fate? The film stars Rachel Zegler as Snow White and Gal Gadot as the evil queen. First of all, I'll say that Zelger has an admittedly good voice, which is necessary for the musical numbers. However, the overall performances from the two leads are not outstanding. I don't know if it's because of the script, direction, or them eyeing a paycheck; whatever it is, the acting isn't exactly noteworthy. Despite the rough first impressions, this remake isn't nearly as soulless as the Lion King one from a few years ago. And, while I am at it, there is some, but not a sufficient amount of imagination in this project.
The film is a colorful adventure through and through. Some of the backgrounds pop with vibrancy and some of the CGI elements, mostly the animals, are adorable and expressive. However, the reliance on CGI is a bit on the heavy side, as it was also applied to the seven dwarves. Yes, you heard that right, the dwarves are CGI animations in this live-action remake. Have they forgotten about prosthetic makeup? They could have even pulled a trick from the Hobbit trilogy, where a taller character is on a green screen, enabling them to be digitally larger than the others. To give credit, though, these dwarves are expressive and are fun to be around.
The musical numbers are also a little forgettable, as the only one I could faintly remember is a song about whistling. The plot has similar beats to the original, but it seems to have taken some deviancies. Though I can see that angering some people, I am one of those people who likes to see some new ideas thrown in. Otherwise, you have virtually no reason to watch these remakes, as they are usually inferior to their source material. The pacing is also a little strange, as it is sometimes speedy, and other times it is as quick as a turtle. Neither are wrong by themselves, but the pacing must be consistent. The ending is a bit abrupt too.
The camerawork is nice, though. Some shots look rather good, but again, the overuse of CGI does hamper some to varying degrees. The goofy sequences with the dwarves are complimented by the zany cinematography. And just as mentioned before, the dwarves are easily the most enjoyable part of this movie. You might ponder whether or not it would have been a better idea to make a spinoff about their lifetimes instead. Even so, there is no reason for this film to be rated as low as 1.6! This movie? Sure, it is far from great, and it is a blatant cash grab; but there is some entertainment to be found here, at least. Also, it's far better than that Lion King remake. Though, I must mention, I haven't seen the original Snow White movie in full, despite how revolutionary and acclaimed it was. Perhaps that will invalidate some of my points here.
Score: 60/100
Summary: This remake has a handful of good ideas, colorful cinematography, and some fun characters to grin at, but almost every element is lacking in some way.",6.0,2025-03-26,10,132,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0
tt6208148,rw10403834,imdbfan-4648469393,Snow White (2024) - Disney's Biggest Embarrassment Yet,"Every once in a while, a movie comes along that is so astoundingly awful, so fundamentally broken, that you wonder how anyone involved thought it was a good idea. Snow White (2024) isn't just bad-it's an unwatchable, soulless, insult to cinema. This isn't a movie; it's a dumpster fire set ablaze by Disney's own arrogance and creative bankruptcy.
A Character Assassination of Snow White
The original Snow White was a timeless classic with a kind-hearted heroine. This version? A smug, bitter, self-righteous shell of a character who lacks any warmth or charm. Rachel Zegler's performance is as grating as her off-screen comments about how much she despises the original film. Instead of a fairy tale princess, we get a condescending know-it-all who sneers at the very idea of romance, heroism, or anything remotely resembling a compelling story arc.
The ""Dwarfs"" - Or Whatever They Are
In what can only be described as one of the worst creative decisions in cinematic history, Disney removed the iconic Seven Dwarfs and replaced them with... a random group of people with no personality, no chemistry, and no reason to exist. They're so forgettable that calling them ""characters"" feels generous. It's like they grabbed a bunch of extras from a failed Netflix show and told them to stand around in the background.
A CGI Catastrophe
Visually, Snow White (2024) is an absolute eyesore. The special effects look unfinished, the cinematography is flat and lifeless, and the color grading makes everything look like it was filmed through a dirty window. The original film from 1937-hand-drawn frame by frame-has more life, beauty, and artistry than this entire multimillion-dollar disaster.
Disney's Most Boring Movie Ever
If this film had any redeeming qualities-funny moments, an emotional core, or even decent action-it might at least be watchable. But there's nothing. The script is atrocious, the pacing is a disaster, and the entire movie is so lifeless that it feels like a punishment to sit through. Every scene drags on with awkward dialogue and dull performances, making Snow White feel like a two-hour endurance test.
Final Verdict: A Career-Ending Disaster
Snow White (2024) isn't just the worst Disney remake-it might be the worst thing the studio has ever produced. It's an insult to the original, a disaster of storytelling, and proof that modern Disney has lost every shred of creativity. Avoid this mess at all costs.

This film strips away the charm, heart, and magic of the 1937 classic, replacing it with a lifeless, uninspired story that feels more like a generic fantasy film than a true adaptation of a Disney legend.
The biggest issue is the screenplay. The film attempts to modernize the character of Snow White but does so in a way that makes her completely unrelatable. Instead of a kind and warm-hearted heroine, we get a bland and overly serious protagonist lacking any emotional depth. The supporting characters are just as forgettable, and the absence of the iconic seven dwarfs in their traditional roles is a huge misstep.
Visually, the film is a mixed bag. While some of the CGI looks polished, other effects come off as artificial and unconvincing. The production design lacks the whimsy of the original, and the cinematography is dull and uninspired. Even the musical elements feel out of place, with songs that fail to capture the magic of the classic soundtrack.
Overall, Snow White is yet another unnecessary and underwhelming live-action remake from Disney.

I've seen all the other Snow White movies and unfortunately as much as I like Gal Godot she didn't hold a candle to Charlize Theron in her portrayal, maybe she shouldn't have tried a musical. In fact I think this movie was more musical theatre than a big screen film. I felt like they may have spent the majority of the budget to get Gal to do the movie, she didn't have a huge amount of lines and what she did have she over acted in them.
The female lead playing Snow White was a great actress but I also think it was just rubbish directing and and musical theatre
The story was odd, think of Snow White, the seven dwarves and Robin and his merry men. It was hard to watch. Like I said, if I was a 10 year old girl I probably would have loved it. I loved Gals costumes, they spent too much to get her and not enough on the rest of the film. My lowest rating ever for a movie. 1 star.",1.0,2025-03-25,10,1,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

I was familiar with all the negative comments prior to its opening, but I have seen many fine films attacked unfairly for a variety of reasons that I've ended up loving. I do not allow critic reviews or peoples opinions to determine my love of a film I wanted SNOW WHITE to be one that was maligned by others but loved by me. Sadly, it wasn't. Even at an hour and 49 minutes the movie drags terribly. I was bored too much of the time. There are subplots to the original story that come out of nowhere that make little sense to why they are there other than to give the old story a little kick. The message that is sent at the end is a good one, but it's conveyed too late in the story and not strong enough. The mixture of live action and CGI occasionally blend nicely, but all too often reminds one of the process and takes the viewer out of the story. I kept thinking ""why didn't they just stick to the original and make the entire movie CGI""? That would've been more visually exciting than the weird combination of dark effects you get here. Poor Rachel Zegler has a nice persona, but doesn't possess the necessary ""magic"" needed for the character. She's stuck in a dull fantasy where too much responsibility is placed upon her to hold together. She's frankly a little too mature for the part of Snow White and while Gal Gadot works valiantly to muster evil in every expression, the woman is too nice and friendly looking to ever be perceived as frightening or evil. She and Zegler could easily switch roles. The one nice piece of casting is Andrew Burnap who is at home in these type of surroundings and is refreshing as the counter part to the Prince. The CGI Dwarfs, rather than endearing, often made me cringe in embarrassment. I might have warmed up to the picture if the score was good. It isn't. The new songs are horribly monotone sounding like they're trying desperately to be like prior Disney musicals. I really hated the score. In short, the movie lacks imagination and is all over the place in search of what it wants to be. A real flatfooted disappointment for this viewer.

tt6208148,rw10423354,http406-NotAcceptable,A Fairy Tale Without Shadows,"This latest adaptation of the classic fairy tale proves to be a failure on multiple fronts, rushing through its narrative as if desperate to reach the credits. Save for occasional flashbacks, the entire story uncomfortably unfolds within what feels like a 24-hour period, robbing the tale of its natural rhythm and depth.
Gal Gadot's Evil Queen emerges as an over-the-top narcissist, pushing past delicious villainy into caricature. Her musical number ""All is Fair"" plays like a small-stage production, complete with backup dancers that feel more Broadway than Brothers Grimm. Meanwhile, our supposed forest-dwelling thieves appear to have wandered off an Urban Outfitters photoshoot, their impossibly pristine costumes betraying any sense of authentic hardship.
But perhaps the film's greatest sin lies in its fundamental misunderstanding of Snow White's essence. Where even Disneyland's classic ride embraces the necessary darkness of the tale - with its haunted forests and genuine scares - this adaptation bathes everything in an artificial cheerfulness that undermines the story's power. The cinematography is too clean, too bright, stripped of the shadows that give fairy tales their weight.
Without darkness, there can be no true contrast - no real triumph over evil, no genuine escape from danger, no earned happiness. By sanitizing these elements, the film has gutted the very aspects that have made Snow White's story endure for generations. The result is a hollow fairy tale that, despite its polished surface, fails to capture any of the magic that makes these stories matter.

Where other movies are playfully reimagining the backstories of famous villains, this one plays it straight, but with carefully curated revisionist tweaks. These are all too obviously agonising and backlash-second-guessing, but knowing that at some basic level the brand identity has to be kept pristine. This is particularly evident in the costume design, with which the wicked witch gets a pointy dark crown and skull-hugging black balaclava and Snow White is lumbered with a supermarket-retail tweenie outfit with puffy-sleeved shoulders. Those otherwise estimable performers Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot are now forced to go through the motions, and they give the dullest performances of their lives.

There are some changes: the hero is no longer a prince, but a more democratic citizen who leads a Robin Hood type insurgency from the forest against the witch's tyranny with SW joining in on a Maid Marian basis. But he still gets to do the controversial non-consent kiss once our heroine has gone into her picturesque coma. But the dwarves? Will this film make them look sort of like everyone else, like the Munchkins in Wicked? No. This Snow White feebly makes them mo-cap (motion-capture) animated figures, but it also - heartsinkingly - duplicates their presence by giving the prince his own gang of seven live-action bandits, in which people with dwarfism are represented. This fudged, pseudo-progressive approach is so tiring you'll want to put your head in your hands.

Awful.

The attempt to infuse the character with more agency feels forced and detracts from the story's coherence. Gal Gadot's performance as the Evil Queen lacks the menace and depth required, resulting in a portrayal that is neither menacing nor campy enough to leave a lasting impression.

Musically, the film introduces new songs that fail to resonate, lacking the memorability of the original score. The number ""All is Fair,"" performed by Gadot, is particularly weak, highlighting the overall uninspired musical direction.

The animated movie is graceful, sweet and timid. You really feel for snow white as she is delicate, sweet and kind. (In the original)

I really feel as though if they are going to modernise some aspects of the film, they could have upgraded her hair and dress, pay owe to the original film, but the dress was too costumey, it was giving low budget. Rachel Zegler wears a dress in the hungergames and her hair was much better, it could have been prettier, but they failed here. And, I know we should focus less on beauty and vanity as a society, because it literally can enslave you, like the evil queen shows in this movie, people need to stop focussing less on peoples appearance, but Rachel is beautiful, the presentation is what let her down in this movie, which is out of her control, but her confidence owns it and she trusted the creative vision and that is why she is fair to Disney and that is what an actress should do, do her job for what she is paid to do and show up and trust the directors vision and she did and she delivered, she got her cheque at the end of the day.

I think the sweet vunerability makes you really feel for snow white in the original also, you really feel protective over her as a viewer, but in this you just don't get the same energy watching.

I loved Rachel Zeglers performance of ""Waiting on a Wish"" She sings beautifully! She deserves praise for her vocals here and I loved her vocals in Romeo & Juliet and Hungergames, she has proved her worthy status as a singer and actress in other films and her acting is of high quality in this movie also.

The movie is lacking in charm, when comparing to the original, they just werent able to translate the same charm from the dwarves, their personalities shined more in the original movie and enhanced the storyline and the classic animated animals personalities added additional charm, as a fan of the original, I can't help but compare to the original.

I was rooting for this film and don't completely hate it, but I think it just doesn't have the same energy, but still gets the message across, but just not as charming or impressive. Still love Rachel though, sorry if you hate her, but I like her, anyways, go see it or wait for it on Disney+, I think I would watch it again for the main song and it was quite easy-watching also.",6.0,2025-03-21,6,75,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0
tt6208148,rw10398018,mmarab91,"""Snow White"" Remake: A Disappointing Reinterpretation","The recent Snow White remake, unfortunately, falls short of capturing the charm and heart of the original Disney classic. While it attempts to modernize the story, the film seems to prioritize contemporary themes over the fundamental aspects that made the original tale so beloved.
One of the main issues with this remake is its shift in focus from Snow White's personal growth and her relationships with the dwarfs to more modern, preachy themes about independence and self-reliance. These themes feel forced and detract from the emotional core of the story. The original Snow White was a symbol of kindness and resilience, and these qualities are less emphasized here, which makes the character feel less relatable and harder to root for.
The portrayal of Snow White in this version is another point of concern. While the actress delivers her performance with determination, the character's warmth and innocence-key to the original-are largely absent. Instead of an endearing figure, Snow White here feels more like a character shaped by modern ideals rather than the timeless virtues that made her stand out in the classic.
Similarly, the Evil Queen, once a complex and menacing villain, is reduced to a less compelling figure. Her motivations feel unclear, and the character lacks the depth and menace that made her such a memorable antagonist in the original film.
The film's attempt to infuse social commentary into the narrative is another area where it struggles. While it's important for films to reflect societal values, the messages in this remake often feel overly forced, detracting from the story rather than enhancing it. It's clear that the intention was to create a more empowering story, but the execution leaves much to be desired.
Visually, the film is polished and colorful, but its flashy aesthetics can't mask the lack of emotional depth. There's a sense that the filmmakers were more concerned with spectacle than with crafting a story that resonates with audiences on a deeper level.
Ultimately, while this Snow White remake offers a fresh take, it doesn't quite live up to the spirit of the original. It prioritizes modern themes over the timeless qualities of the classic story, which may leave long-time fans disappointed.",1.0,2025-03-23,11,2,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

A Snow White That Doesn't Feel Like Snow White
Right from the start, the film felt... off. The casting of Rachel Zegler as Snow White was controversial for many reasons, but for me, it wasn't just about appearances. She lacked the charm, innocence, and warmth that made the original Snow White so beloved. Instead of being the sweet and kind princess we remember, this version of Snow White comes off as overly modernized and unrelatable.

tt0029583,rw10395859,masonsaul,The good outweighs the bad ( just about),"Snow White tries to simultaneously be a complete reinvention of the animated original and a very faithful adaptation where scenes are lifted directly from its predecessor so the results are undoubtedly messy but it avoids being the worst Disney live action remake. It tries to fix most of the problems with its source material in a noble fashion and a lot of the new ideas work well enough, they just almost go unnoticed thanks to the couple of truly baffling ones.
Rachel Zegler is this film's saving grace. Her fantastic singing voice gets plenty of moments to shine and she consistently imbues the film with all the necessary warmth and elegance despite everything working against her, mainly the unflattering haircut she has and some uncanny scene partners. Gal Gadot gives a career worst performance, even if she's clearly relishing the villainy she gets to play it's just so painful to watch, especially when she starts singing.
The no longer titular seven dwarves are relentlessly uncanny and the camera gets way too close to them most of the time which only makes it worse. The second they appear the film goes straight into the uncanny valley and even though they remain a jolly highlight throughout as they did in the original, it's never enough to fully escape it. It's such a strange (at best) creative choice however, the new character arc given to Dopey really works.
Marc Webb's direction is completely authorless and it makes no sense that he'd choose to make this after the notoriously tumultuous production of his Amazing Spider-Man duology under Sony. There's some vibrant sequences and it's generally pretty colourful, only employing a bland grey palette for scenes where it kinda fits.

Marc Webb's direction was, at best, a textbook example of average filmmaking-a lesson in how to mishandle a classic story. His approach lacked any spark of originality, to the point where even over-the-top silliness would've been a welcome change.
The seven dwarfs? They weren't even real actors-just a bunch of CGI creations that couldn't muster an ounce of personality. Their awkward musical performances felt like a kazoo crashing a symphony orchestra: jarring, misplaced, and a failed stab at adding some flair that only highlighted the film's overall messiness.
Rachel Zegler's take on Snow White was dull and lifeless, swinging between forgettable and stiff. Then there's Gal Gadot as the evil queen-her over-the-top smugness came off as forced and unconvincing. The total absence of chemistry between the actors just made the film's flaws even more glaring.
From the weak performances to the awkward musical bits, every part of this movie worked together to deliver something creatively empty and unintentionally laughable. It's baffling how a film can take a cherished story, waste its potential, and disrespect its audience all at once.

tt6208148,rw10421632,imdbfan-7397861819,GET BETTER,"First off, let's talk about the pacing-or lack thereof. Snow White is like that one friend who talks too slowly and insists on explaining every detail, even though you stopped listening five minutes ago. For a movie that's barely over an hour long, it feels like it drags on for an eternity. The ""action"" is so sparse, I found myself counting the seconds between moments of actual interest. Spoiler alert: there are very few. It's just Snow White getting chased by a queen who has a really unhealthy obsession with mirrors, and a bunch of dwarfs who do... well, honestly, I'm not sure what they're doing, but it's mostly standing around and singing songs no one asked for.

Speaking of the dwarfs, can we just talk about how completely unnecessary they are? Are they supposed to be comic relief? Because there's nothing funny about them. They might as well have been replaced with cardboard cutouts, for all the character development they get. They wander in and out of scenes, sing songs that don't add to the plot, and act like they're the most important part of the movie. Spoiler: they're not. The movie would have been just as ""thrilling"" without them.

And then we get to Snow White herself. Look, I get that she's supposed to be sweet and pure and innocent, but good lord, this girl is just too much. She literally spends the whole movie either singing, skipping around, or napping. That's right-napping. For a good portion of the movie, Snow White is just unconscious, taking naps like she's the queen of napping. Not the princess, mind you-the queen of naps. For someone who's supposed to be the lead character, she doesn't do much of anything except wait for someone else to save her. In fact, the only time she's remotely ""active"" is when she's running away from an evil queen who is, honestly, more interesting than Snow White herself. But no, we can't have that-let's focus on the damsel in distress while the real drama is happening offscreen.

Now, onto the ""evil"" queen. I use the term ""evil"" loosely here because, frankly, the queen isn't scary. She's whiny. Her entire character arc revolves around being mad that someone else is considered beautiful. And that's it. Oh, she tries to kill Snow White a few times, but her methods are so ridiculous that you can't help but wonder if she even wants to win. Her poison apple? Please. It's the most anticlimactic plot device ever. She hands Snow White a cursed fruit, and boom-sleeping beauty style, Snow White takes a nap. That's the big moment. The drama that was supposed to keep me on the edge of my seat just left me rolling my eyes.

Let's talk about the music for a moment. It's as if they were trying to make a musical, but forgot to add any memorable tunes. The songs are incredibly forgettable, and the only one that sticks in your head is ""Hi-ho, hi-ho, it's off to work we go,"" but that's more annoying than catchy. The rest of the music is just filler, meant to pad out the time between scenes where nothing happens. I'm not expecting a Broadway-level soundtrack, but a little effort wouldn't have hurt.

And the animation? Sure, it was groundbreaking for its time, but now? It looks dated. The movements are stiff, the backgrounds look flat, and don't get me started on the character designs. Snow White's face has this odd, lifeless quality to it, like she's perpetually shocked to see something she didn't understand. The evil queen, when she transforms into her old hag persona, is more laughable than frightening, and let's be honest, the dwarfs all look like they were designed by someone who didn't quite understand anatomy.

The worst part of all of this is that there is potential here. A villainous queen, a girl on the run, a poisoned apple-these are all the ingredients for a dark, compelling story. But no, instead we get this dull, sluggish mess where nothing happens and the stakes are nonexistent. We're supposed to care about Snow White's fate, but it's hard to when she barely does anything to change her situation. It's all left to the dwarfs, the prince, and-well, luck.

If you want to watch a movie where nothing of interest happens, characters are as flat as the animation, and the villain's evil plan is more comical than dangerous, Snow White is your movie. Otherwise, I'd suggest you skip this one. Honestly, it's a wonder it's still remembered today, given how boring and forgettable it is. One star. It's a shame the mirror didn't tell Snow White that she wasn't the fairest of them all-this movie certainly isn't.",1.0,2025-03-31,9,1,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

First off, the writing is painfully bland. The script tries so hard to be modern and ""empowering"" that it forgets to actually tell a compelling story. Snow White herself comes off less like a heroine and more like a confused side character in her own tale. The dwarfs - or whatever this version tries to call them - are barely fleshed out and feel like afterthoughts.

Dear Disney, blink twice if you need help. Because whatever spell you were under while making this - it backfired.
And let's be real - this isn't just a Snow White problem. Disney has been slowly losing its magic over the past five years like a wizard who dropped his wand in a sewer. Not every movie has been a disaster, sure, but the ratio of hits to head-scratchers is starting to look like a losing bingo card.
They've traded heart, soul, and storytelling for glossy visuals, weird remakes no one asked for, and scripts that feel like they were written by an AI fed nothing but inspirational Instagram quotes and corporate synergy meetings.

The once magical elements are now lifeless, and the over-reliance on CGI makes the world feel artificial rather than enchanting. The film drags on with long, unnecessary scenes that leave you checking the time.
What's worse is that even children, who are the target audience, seemed uninterested and restless. The movie's attempt at humor is forced, and the characters, especially Snow White, are one-dimensional. The dwarfs, who were supposed to be quirky and lovable, feel flat and unremarkable. There's no heart in this version, and it struggles to capture the essence of the original tale, leaving viewers-young and old-feeling bored and disconnected.

tt6208148,rw10398134,prommie,"Mirror, mirror on the wall - who's the biggest disaster of them all?","I approached the film with low expectations, but what awaited me there undercut even these. This film is not just a failed remake - it is a prime example of how to distort a timeless classic beyond recognition. The magic of the original has been replaced by sterile images, lifeless acting and a plot that is clearly ashamed of its own identity.
Rachel Zegler as Snow White comes across as consistently distant, almost as if she doesn't believe in the story she's telling. Her performance lacks warmth, and any form of charisma is sorely missing. And while her voice has potential, the songs remain pale and forgettable the moment they fade. The musical magic of the original? Gone without a trace.
Gal Gadot, who visually fits the role of the Evil Queen without question, delivers a performance that swings between overacted pathos and emotionless routine. She's neither frightening nor fascinating - just completely out of place. Her scenes feel more like a fashion campaign with dialogue than a film performance.
What shocked me most was the visual execution. Despite the enormous budget, the film looks like an overlong commercial from post-production hell. The CGI depiction of the ""dwarfs"" (if we're even allowed to call them that anymore) is so artificial, I felt secondhand embarrassment. These figures have neither charm nor personality - they are mere digital shadows of once-beloved characters.
But the film's biggest flaw lies in its core attitude: instead of developing the story or respectfully reinterpreting it, it goes out of its way to distance itself from the original - and in doing so, completely loses its emotional core. The romantic component is sacrificed for ideological reasons without offering anything of equal value in return. What remains is a narrative that neither moves nor inspires.
Throughout the entire runtime, I kept asking myself why this film even exists. Anyone who loves the original should avoid this soulless product at all costs.

And the plot twists! Who knew you could stretch a fairy tale into a convoluted mess that leaves you longing for a good old-fashioned nap? The dialogue is a masterpiece of banality, perfect for anyone who enjoys conversations as riveting as paint drying.
The real gem, though, is the soundtrack. Each song is a delightful reminder of how much you miss the originals, delivered with the enthusiasm of someone forced to sing at gunpoint.

We were pleasantly surprised by how well Disney adapted the original Snow White while also adding the smallest twist to appeal more to younger audiences. The plot of the movie follows the original pretty closely with a couple of extra scenes added to develop Snow White and other characters. There were no major deviances from the original movie, except of the Evil Queen's death.
The musical numbers were gas, fire, flames. Genuinely the best part of the movie was anytime someone sang, which was the majority of the movie. Snow White's dress was stunning, and the Evil Queen's design was also well done. The only horrible outfit was the main guy's, but it wasn't super distracting. He was charming and convincing as Snow's love interest. Gal Gadot also did great as the Evil Queen, her performance was dramatic like a classic Disney villain and scared me just as much as the original. The color grading and cinematography were also pretty good. It did not look dull or lifeless like the Little Mermaid did.
The only major cons of this movie are the seven dwarves and the pacing. Every time the dwarves were on screen it was jarring, but despite that I still found myself emotionally connecting with these characters. There was also an issue with how jarring some of the transitions were between scenes and the shift in tone. Some parts of the plot were not fully explained/developed. I think a majority of the critics of this movie are forgetting that it is meant for kids, and are upset that it is not a carbon copy of the original.
While the movie is not perfect, I would recommend seeing this movie if you like musicals or have kids. Just don't expect it to be as good as the original if Snow White is one of your favorites.",8.0,2025-03-26,7,59,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

The 1937 Disney classic, itself an adaptation of the Brothers Grimm fairytale, is cherished for its simplicity and charm that is Snow White is a gentle, pure-hearted princess who finds refuge with the seven dwarfs and is ultimately saved by a prince. This version reimagines her as a more proactive, leader-driven figure who teams up with bandits and dwarfs to overthrow her stepmother, the Evil Queen.

tt6208148,rw10413998,imdbfan-4682530099,A Disastrous Reimagining of a Classic,"Disney's latest live-action adaptation, Snow White, proves that not all classic stories need modern reinvention-especially when the essence of the original is lost in the process. From weak writing to uninspired performances, this film falls short of the magic that made the 1937 animated masterpiece a beloved classic.
One of the most glaring issues is Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White. While she has undeniable vocal talent, her performance lacks the charm and warmth that made the original character so endearing. Instead of embodying Snow White's innocence and kindness, Zegler's take on the character feels detached, lacking the emotional depth needed to carry the film. Whether due to the script or her own approach, she struggles to make the role feel genuine, leaving audiences without a protagonist to truly root for.
Beyond the casting, the film suffers from a misguided attempt to modernize the story. While updating classic fairy tales can be refreshing, Snow White strips away much of what made the original compelling, replacing it with a forced narrative that feels more like a generic fantasy adventure than a timeless fairy tale. The lack of the iconic dwarfs as we know them, coupled with uninspired CGI and lackluster world-building, only adds to the film's identity crisis.
Visually, the movie is inconsistent. While some scenes showcase impressive production design, others are weighed down by overuse of CGI that lacks the polish expected from a high-budget Disney film. The musical numbers, though competently performed, lack the staying power of the original's unforgettable songs.
Ultimately, Snow White feels like a missed opportunity. Rather than honoring the legacy of the first Disney animated feature, it tries too hard to be something it's not, alienating fans of the original while failing to captivate a new audience. Disney has had success with live-action remakes in the past, but this one is unlikely to join the ranks of Cinderella or The Jungle Book.",1.0,2025-03-29,5,0,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

Watching it felt like being trapped in an elevator with someone explaining their dream in excruciating detail-except somehow worse. It's not just a failure; it's a crime against storytelling, a disgrace to cinema, and an insult to anyone unfortunate enough to sit through it.
Let's start with the script-or what I assume was a pile of incoherent notes scribbled on napkins and then fed through a shredder. The dialogue is so horrifically written that I genuinely wondered if the writers had ever heard real human beings talk before. Characters don't have conversations; they just spew nonsense at each other with all the charm of a malfunctioning robot. Every attempt at humor lands with a deafening silence, and the so-called dramatic moments are about as moving as a wet cardboard box.
The acting? If it were any stiffer, the cast would be mistaken for department store mannequins. The lead actor looks permanently confused, as if they wandered onto set by accident, while the supporting cast delivers performances so atrocious that I suspect they were being held hostage and forced to act against their will. There is zero chemistry between any of the characters, making every interaction feel like an awkward school play where no one bothered to rehearse.
The pacing is an absolute nightmare. Some scenes drag on so long that I started questioning my own existence, while others are so rushed that they barely make sense. The film somehow manages to be both painfully slow and completely incoherent at the same time, which should be impossible, yet here we are.
Visually, it's a complete disaster. The cinematography is so lazy that half the shots look like they were filmed on a potato, and the lighting is so bad that at times I thought my screen was broken. The special effects (if you can even call them that) are laughably bad-like something from a low-budget student film, but without any of the charm. The editing is so jarring that I felt like I was watching a series of random clips stitched together by someone who just discovered video software five minutes before the deadline.
And the soundtrack-oh, the soundtrack. Imagine the worst, most ill-fitting music choices possible, then somehow make them even worse. It's like they picked random tracks from a free stock music website and just threw them in with no thought whatsoever. At times, the music is so loud and overbearing that it drowns out what little dialogue there is, which honestly might be a blessing in disguise.
By the time the credits mercifully rolled, I felt like I had aged ten years. This film didn't just waste my time-it actively stole my will to live. If I had to choose between watching it again or stepping on a thousand LEGO bricks barefoot, I'd take the LEGO bricks every single time.

tt6208148,rw10412895,eve_dolluk,Its not bad,"I went with my friend and her 3 kids, aged 8, 6 and 4, her youngest was too young to go aged 2.
So a fairly young audience plus myself and my friend.
Ill try and give you some of the kids feedback although its not like i grilled them.
The 8 year old boy loved the dwarves and found them funny, he only liked 2 of the songs, High ho and the silly song and said the others were a bit boring.
Thr 6 year old girl was mesmerized from start to finish, loved all the songs but loves waiting on a wish, her mum says its on repeat on youtube.
The 4 year old boy managed to stay interested and quiet throughout and didnt say too much except he liked Dopey and Grumpy ( Dopeys dad apparently 😀😀 )
They all liked the mining cart sequence and want to do a mining cart ride. The 2 youngest found the witch scary especially as a hag but also as the queen. The eldest didn't find anything scary 😐😐.
The 2 eldest would watch it again, the youngest just shouted ' No' 😮
What did the adults think ?
Personally I found it ok, I thought Snow Whites dress was a bit cheap and cosplay looking but kind of fitted the cartoony vibe, her hair kind of annoyed me as well, it looked a bit out of place.
I liked the Dwarves animation and look, it matched the cartoon vibe and the original animation, plus they added a fun comedic vibe.
The songs were good, a few of the classics and some new additions. Waiting on a wish was very good, the opening song was really good as well ' good things grow ', very full of energy and had a greatest showman vibe.
I found the songs in this miles better than Mufasa - The Lion King, also this films pacing was a lot better especially for the kids. They never liked Mufasa and said it was boring.
The music overall was orchestral and strong, that was a huge positive.
Story wise its a classic tale of jealousy so nothing new on that front.
My friend enjoyed it as well but was just happy to be able to relax with the kids quiet for 90 mins 😀😀.
The kids response was probably an 8 or 9.
Id give it a 6.5 as it often looked a bit cheap at times but it did sound amazing.
Overall a 7.5/10. Kids loved it.",7.0,2025-03-28,1,8,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

The pacing is awful, and there are so many unanswered questions. For example, when Snow White marches to the palace to protest, everyone immediately recognizes her as the princess-but wasn't it stated earlier that the people had completely forgotten she even existed?

Not only that, Jonathan's character is lacking-the film portrays him as this 'Robin Hood' character, yet he is anything but that-he fights in the name of the king, but what has he done for the people before he met Snow White?

Gal Gadot's singing was so bad that even autotune couldn't have saved her, you could hear her voice cracking when she was singing. She should have just voiced the old woman, her voice suits that role better.

To address Gadot's acting, I already knew she wasn't great, but I didn't expect her to be this terrible-even my GPS sounds more invested in what it's saying. It was bland, forgettable, and completely devoid of any emotion. God knows how she is so famous.

As for the costumes-whoever designed them needs to quit immediately. They are clearly not cut out for this job. They look like something you'd get at a theme park gift shop-absolutely horrendous.

The most ridiculous thing of all-is when the soldiers change sides because Snow White remembers who they are. It's not a bad thing if it's executed well enough, but in this scene, it wasn't. They don't give the people a reason to care for Snow White other than the fact that her and her family baked apple pies and gave them out to the people a couple of years ago. Not only that, if it took that little effort for the soldiers to switch sides then the Evil Queen's kingdom would have collapsed long ago.


The CGI dwarves look as if Alvin the Chipmunk and his friends were caught in a radioactive fallout-it was unsettling. Why could they not hire real life dwarves?

tt6208148,rw10413816,imdbfan-5426936066,Worse than expected.,"Its just plain bad. Everything. Just bad.
The new Snow White movie, a reimagining of Disney's classic animated tale, is a striking example of how even the most beloved stories can be misjudged when handed to the wrong creative team. While modern adaptations often try to add fresh perspectives or bring diverse interpretations to the table, this version falls short in almost every way, leaving fans of the original classic and newcomers to the story alike feeling underwhelmed.
First and foremost, the film's pacing feels rushed and disjointed. Where the original animated film had a magical, almost dreamlike quality to it, this new iteration is often plagued by awkward transitions between scenes, which disrupt any sense of flow or coherence. The plot, which should center around Snow White's coming-of-age journey, her escape from the evil queen, and the eventual rescue by her prince, is muddled with unnecessary subplots and awkward dialogue that seem to dilute the emotional core of the story. What should have been a fairy tale filled with wonder and fantasy comes off instead as a string of disconnected moments that fail to captivate.
The performances, unfortunately, don't fare much better. While the lead actress playing Snow White has undoubtedly been chosen for her star power, her portrayal feels lifeless and underwhelming. Rather than embodying the warmth, innocence, and charm that made Snow White such a relatable and beloved character in the original, this version feels distant, with little emotional depth. Even the scenes that should feel empowering or inspiring fall flat because of the lack of connection to her character's plight.
Perhaps one of the biggest letdowns is the reworking of the film's villain, the Evil Queen. In an attempt to modernize the character, the film reimagines her motivations in a way that feels out of place within the context of the classic tale. Instead of the malevolent, obsessive force of vanity and jealousy, this new Evil Queen feels more like a misunderstood figure, which detracts from the terrifying power of her presence. The film attempts to make her more human, but in doing so, it loses the dark allure that made her such an iconic antagonist.
Visually, the movie offers some stunning shots, but it's clear that the special effects often take priority over actual storytelling. Beautiful landscapes and CGI creatures are overused, filling the screen with eye candy that distracts from the story rather than enhancing it. It's as if the filmmakers were more concerned with showing off technical prowess than crafting an emotional narrative, and this leaves the audience with a hollow experience, no matter how pretty the visuals might be.
In terms of the music, the film tries to incorporate modern songs and styles, but this choice seems jarring and out of place. The original score, with its whimsical melodies, perfectly captured the tone of the classic Snow White, while the new soundtrack fails to evoke the same sense of nostalgia or wonder. The songs, while catchy, feel forced and often detract from the mood of the scenes, making them feel more like insertions rather than organic parts of the story.
Ultimately, this Snow White movie is a missed opportunity. It attempts to bring new ideas to the table but does so at the cost of the essence of the original tale. The result is a movie that feels directionless, emotionally flat, and ultimately forgettable. For those hoping for a faithful reimagining or a story that stands out on its own, this adaptation disappoints on both fronts.",1.0,2025-03-28,7,1,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0
tt6208148,rw10413617,eximpwnz,Trash,"Disney's latest live-action adaptation of ""Snow White"" is a disheartening misstep that fails to capture the magic of the original classic. The film is marred by subpar performances, a lackluster narrative, and misguided directorial choices, making it an experience many viewers might wish to forget.
Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White lacks the depth and charm necessary to engage audiences. Her performance feels superficial, leaving the character devoid of the innocence and warmth that endeared her to generations. Similarly, Gal Gadot's attempt at the Evil Queen is disappointingly one-dimensional. Her over-the-top delivery transforms a potentially menacing antagonist into a caricature, stripping away any semblance of genuine threat. Critics have noted her overacting and lack of depth compared to previous portrayals of the Queen.
The storyline is a convoluted mess, straying far from the original narrative without offering any meaningful innovation. The plot's attempt to modernize the tale results in a disjointed and uninspired script that fails to resonate. The film's modernization efforts lack the appeal of the original, leaving audiences yearning for the timeless simplicity of the 1937 version.
Director Marc Webb's vision for this remake is bewildering. The film oscillates between tones, unable to decide whether it wants to honor its source material or subvert it. This indecisiveness results in a jarring viewing experience that lacks cohesion. The narrative introduces complex new subplots but fails to maintain a consistent tone, preventing the movie from delivering a unified and impactful retelling of the classic tale.
The production's shortcomings are so pronounced that the pre-film advertisements provided more entertainment than the feature itself. The desire to request a refund is understandable, as the film offers little to justify the price of admission.

I would forgive any inherent misses in her acting prowess (or lack thereof), but it's all but impossible to get past Disney's modernization of her character. Modernization in itself is no problem (see Baz Luhrmann's take on a story 400 years its senior), but Disney failed to adjust Snow White's entire formula, leaving the viewer to cherry pick when, where, and how to suspend disbelief in an otherwise magical character. The most egregious disappointment was the dwarves. Again, Disney has failed to recognize that the rubber-banded rag doll humor of the 1937 dwarves simply cannot be duplicated in CG, especially when the art design can't decide where it belongs in the spectrum of ""real to ""cartoon"".

I walked into the theater with sky-high expectations, hoping to see an inspired remake that honored what made the original so appealing. Instead, I got a mess that not only strayed from the source material but also seemed to intentionally blaspheme it. This was not the Snow White I knew and loved - this was something else entirely, something that made me wonder if Disney even cared about the value of childhood memories anymore. From the start, the film confused me with its character development. The Wicked Witch, who was a symbol of pride and beauty in the original story, now appears in all her glory, but is jealous of an ugly Snow White? I'm not even sure if I should call her ""Snow White"" anymore, because that name just doesn't seem right. In the original, Snow White is the embodiment of purity and natural beauty, but here, she's turned into a bland, lifeless character who leaves no impression other than being confusing. This strange reversal not only takes away from the story's meaning, but also makes the relationship between the two main characters absurd and unconvincing. The plot is twisted beyond recognition. One of the highlights of the original was how Snow White found comfort and friendship with the seven dwarfs, who worked hard in the quarries. But in Snow White 2025, everything is turned upside down in an unpleasant way. Snow White stays at the dwarfs' house not to share work or build meaningful relationships, but to sing and dance? Meanwhile, the seven dwarfs, who have been working hard all day, return home only to find themselves with a pile of chores that Snow White seems to have left untouched. Seriously, what is going on? Not only is this change absurd, it completely destroys the spirit of unity and mutual support that was at the heart of the story. The other unnecessary changes in the film only add to my disappointment. I understand that a remake needs to be creative to suit a modern audience, but what Disney did here was not creative, but destructive. They added unnecessary details, changed the characters' personalities arbitrarily, and ignored the core values that made Snow White such a timeless work. I can't help but feel that the production team tried too hard to refresh the story, but ended up turning it into something alien, lacking the soul of the original. As a Snow White fan since I was a child, I feel betrayed. Not only did the film disappoint me, but it also made me worry about the future of other classics that Disney might touch. My childhood memories - afternoons spent watching the 1937 animated version over and over again, singing along to the cheerful songs, and daydreaming about a fairytale world - are now tainted by this 2025 version. I cannot understand why Disney chose this path, instead of honoring the legacy they have built over generations. In short, Snow White 2025 is a disaster that is not worth the time.

tt6208148,rw10405814,CinemaSerf,Show White,"Ouch! Now this was always going to be a difficult story to imaginatively reimagine, and I do wonder just who Disney thought this was for as it quite radically alters the timeless fairy tale and augments it with some remarkably unremarkable power ballads and set piece choreography that wouldn't have looked out of place at a barn dance. This iteration of the story pretty much abandons the fantasy elements of the original one and tells us of a wicked queen who has tricked her way onto the throne and turned the princess ""Snow White"" (Rachel Zegler) into something more akin to a royal ""Cinderella"". Luckily for her, she encounters the enthusiastic bandit ""Jonathan"" (Andrew Burnap) who has broken into the palace to pinch some spuds, and next thing they are both trying to stay one step ahead of the Queen (Gal Gadot) who is narked by her mirror telling her she's just plain ugly so she wants them deceased! It does swing by the brothers Grimm every now and again, and there are seven singing dwarves to ""work the whole day long"", but even they can't breathe much life into this surprisingly mundane exercise in superb technical creativity but otherwise lacklustre amateur stage theatricals. The unmistakably familiar score from Messrs. Pasek and Paul keeps threatening to break into ""You Will Be Found"" from ""Dear Evan Hansen"" and aside from, perhaps, ""Waiting on a Wish"" the soundtrack - like the whole thing - is disappointingly forgettable as it avoids every potential hint of menace progressing through a fondue of gloop towards it's conclusion. Thank heavens for ""Grumpy"" (Martin Kleppa) who is probably the only one on-screen in synch with those of us watching. If you do want to see it then cinema is definitely best.

Disney completely failed to catch the style of the original movie, instead going for horribly bad CGI (which we already got used to by them), very mediocre actors (Gal Gadot, Rachel Zagler) who don't ever seem like they actually want to be in this movie. The story got chopped, the actors are bad, the CGI is bad, the costumes are cheap, the music is sometimes bad and sometimes meh (Zegler can sing, but the songs are bad) and overall this is just trash.

The production falters, unable to both honor its source material and forge a compelling independent narrative.
A primary deficiency lies within the screenplay's sterility. The characters are devoid of dimensionality, the spoken exchanges feel contrived, and the film fails to cultivate any palpable emotional resonance with its viewers. Crucial components of the familiar tale are reconfigured, yet these alterations, rather than enhancing the narrative, serve to dilute its intrinsic charm.
The acting performances are similarly underwhelming. Rachel Zegler's depiction of Snow White is marked by a dearth of magnetism and vitality, rendering the character pedestrian and, at times, unsympathetic. Furthermore, the substitute figures for the seven dwarfs are poorly conceptualized and contribute negligibly to the storyline's progression.
In terms of its visual and production values, the film is remarkably lackluster for a Disney endeavor. The computer-generated imagery appears inexpensive, the backdrops seem artificial, and rather than conjuring a sense of enchantment, the movie presents a flat and uninspired aesthetic.
Ultimately, the film conveys a sense of Disney repudiating its own storied heritage. It does not manifest as a heartfelt contemporary interpretation of a cherished classic, but rather as a production driven by ideological conformity with minimal artistic merit. The outcome is a maladapted work that fails to gratify long-standing admirers or capture the interest of new spectators.

Compared to the live-action version of The Little Mermaid that Disney made, it was very similar to the original.

tt6208148,rw10398951,epalminteri,"Less of a remake, more of a reimagining","There were many aspects of this movie that went above and below expectations. As someone who was ecstatic about this movie, it was a little underwhelming, but it did have its positives.
On one hand, the movie was overall entertaining. The ""Waiting on a Wish"" and ""A Hand Meets a Hand"" were catchy additions to the soundtrack, and the additions to the storyline fit well within Disney's intentions to modernize them and add to the classic. For example, expanding upon the love interests involvement in the story and making him less of a random guy that shows up to kiss her eventually was a good way to make his involvement in the film less random. Developing their relationship gave more meaning to her awakening. Visually, the CGI for the mines and the forest scene were pretty cool. I also liked how they made the dwarfs more interesting as creatures. That is about as far as the positives for the film extend.
There was a lot to unpack with the negative parts of the movie. The Evil Queen's performance felt forced, flat, and just overall hard to watch. Snow White's hair has its ups and downs, but ultimately looked like lord farquaad when it mattered. The CGI dwarfs were kind of spooky, but not that bad. I understand what people mean when they say that you could tell that everything was sets, but that shouldn't take away from the details in the sets such as with the outside and inside of the cottage. The chemistry between Snow White and Johnathan was a little awkward. No, I don't think Snow White's outfit was horrendous and hideous. I actually liked that they gave her ballet shoes, because who is actually running around a Forrest in heels and not losing them?
The biggest things to remember are that first of all, these movies aren't just for fans of the original, but also for children who just want to see real-life princesses, and that this was a reimagining more than a remake. If you watch the movie, keep your standards to a minimum. If you pick apart everything about the movie, of course you're not going to enjoy it. Just watch it for what it is: a princess movie to watch with your kids as they sing along with the songs that they now get to grow up with.",6.0,2025-03-24,1,25,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

She didn't quite fit the role, and the writing didn't do her any favors, but she did what she could with the material. Her singing was a highlight, even though the new songs were uninspired and forgettable, she delivered them well. Her accent slipped into American in a few spots, but it wasn't too distracting. Gal Gadot, on the other hand, continues to be a mystery to me. Her performance was flat, awkward, and lacked any screen presence. Even her English felt off at times. Visually, this movie is a step backwards. The CGI was shockingly bad, especially the dwarfs, who looked uncanny. The sets were more of an eyesore than immersive, and the costumes looked like cheap rentals rather than a big-budget production. The story changes didn't help either. Making Snow White a queen at the end felt forced and unearned. The ""Prince"" who isn't even a prince anymore was completely forgettable and contributed little to the story.

tt6208148,rw10415430,imdbfan-6762226769,Disappointed,"Disney's Snow White (2025) is a complete disaster, a soulless cash grab that fails both as a remake and as a standalone film. From the moment it starts, it's clear that the heart and magic of the original are nowhere to be found. Rachel Zegler's Snow White is uninspiring, lacking any of the warmth and charm that made the character beloved. Gal Gadot, despite her talent, delivers a painfully over-the-top performance as the Evil Queen, making it impossible to take her seriously.
The script is lifeless, filled with awkward dialogue and forced modernization that strips the story of any emotional depth. The pacing is horrendous, dragging on with scenes that feel empty and pointless. Even the visual effects, which should be one of the film's highlights given its massive budget, fail to impress. The CGI dwarfs are unsettling and lack personality, making them forgettable at best and cringe-inducing at worst.
Beyond the film's technical failures, the controversies surrounding it only added fuel to the fire. The unnecessary changes, from Snow White's character to the sidelining of classic elements, felt more like a corporate attempt at ticking boxes rather than a genuine effort at storytelling. Instead of delivering a fresh, exciting take on a timeless classic, Disney has given us a watered-down, painfully dull experience that no one asked for.
By the time the credits rolled, I found myself thinking that watching paint dry would have been a more entertaining and fulfilling experience. This film is proof that Disney has lost its touch, churning out soulless remakes that fail to capture the essence of what made their originals special.

First off, the CGI was a mess. The seven dwarfs looked so unnatural that it was distracting. I don't understand why they didn't cast real actors-it would have felt more authentic. Instead, we got weird-looking CGI characters that made it hard to connect with them.

The story changes also didn't sit well with me. The prince being turned into a thief felt forced, and the attempt to add political themes just felt out of place in a fairy tale. Instead of a timeless, magical adventure, it felt like Disney was trying too hard to send a message.

Visually, some moments were nice, but overall, the film looked too artificial. I missed the charm and heart of the original. Rachel Zegler did her best, and Gal Gadot had some great moments as the Evil Queen, but even strong performances couldn't save the film from its messy script and weird creative choices.

tt6208148,rw10420305,imdbfan-4479095457,Slow but very good ending,"I walked into the theater with high hopes, ready to immerse myself in what I expected to be a compelling cinematic experience. The trailers had done their job well, showcasing action-packed sequences, intriguing dialogue, and just enough mystery to draw me in. However, as the movie began, I quickly realized that I was in for something entirely different-something far less engaging than I had anticipated. The opening scenes set the tone for what would ultimately be an underwhelming and, at times, frustrating experience.
From the very start, the pacing felt off. The introduction dragged on unnecessarily, stretching out moments that should have been brief, and stuffing the narrative with exposition that failed to build any real intrigue. Characters were introduced in ways that lacked impact, and their dialogue felt stilted, as if they were simply reciting lines rather than truly embodying their roles. I found myself waiting for that spark-the moment when everything would fall into place and the film would finally become engaging. Unfortunately, that moment never really came.
As the plot unfolded, it became evident that the story lacked direction. It meandered from scene to scene without any real sense of urgency or purpose. Conflicts were introduced but never fully developed, making it difficult to become emotionally invested in the characters or their struggles. The stakes, which should have been high and compelling, felt trivial and unconvincing. Even the supposed emotional moments fell flat, failing to evoke the kind of response that a well-crafted film should.
Visually, the movie had some redeeming qualities. The cinematography, at times, was impressive, with certain shots capturing a level of artistry that momentarily made me forget about the weak script. But even stunning visuals could not compensate for the sheer lack of engagement that the film's narrative provided. The soundtrack, too, had potential, yet it often felt misplaced, as if it was trying too hard to evoke emotions that the story itself had failed to create.
One of the most frustrating aspects of the movie was the way it handled its characters. There were clear attempts to establish depth and complexity, but these attempts often fell short. Some characters were given backstories that seemed promising, only to have those narratives abandoned or resolved in the most unsatisfying ways. Others were simply there to serve as plot devices rather than actual people with motivations and arcs. The performances, while not terrible, were weighed down by the uninspired dialogue and the lack of strong direction. Even talented actors could not save the material they were given.
By the time the third act rolled around, I had all but given up on the film redeeming itself. The climax, which should have been the most exciting and emotionally charged part of the movie, felt rushed and uninspired. There was no real payoff for the buildup-if one could even call it that-and the resolution felt unearned. It was as if the filmmakers had all these ideas but no clear way to tie them together in a satisfying manner.
Then, just as I was ready to leave the theater in disappointment, the post-credit scene began. To my utter surprise, this brief segment was more engaging than the entirety of the film that had preceded it. In just a few moments, it managed to capture the energy, excitement, and intrigue that the rest of the movie had so desperately lacked. It had wit, it had style, and most importantly, it left me with a sense of curiosity-something the main story had failed to do.
I couldn't help but feel frustrated that this level of creativity and engagement had been reserved for a short scene at the very end rather than being infused throughout the entire film. It was almost as if the filmmakers had put more thought and effort into setting up a potential sequel than into making the current movie enjoyable.
As I walked out of the theater, I found myself reflecting on how a movie with so much potential had ultimately turned out to be a disappointment. While the post-credit scene was a small redeeming factor, it could not erase the boredom and frustration I had felt for the majority of the runtime. In the end, it was a film that started terribly, remained lackluster for most of its duration, and only managed to pique my interest at the very last moment-too little, too late.",1.0,2025-03-31,4,0,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0
tt6208148,rw10400831,DakotahManMovies,Snow White Didn't Poison It's Own Apple,"Snow White is the newest Disney live action remake, and it isn't bad. But could be better. The most controversial part about this film is Rachel Zegler, but she is the best part of this movie. The girl knows how to sing (like we saw on hunger games, and other films), and she sings beautifully in this movie. Speaking of singing, the songs in this movie aren't bad. Most of the Disney life action remake don't have good original songs but when you switch over to this movie, there's actually a handful amount of them that I find really good and catchy. Now Gal Gadot is getting hated in this movie saying it is her worst performance yet but the way I see it. She almost matched the role of the evil queen perfectly, now I do have a few Nitpicks, but I didn't hate her performance. And this movie fixed all of my problems that I had with the original film, the pacing is better in this movie and we fleshed out the characters more instead of the storylines being rushed. All my problems with the original film isn't in this movie, so theoretically that will make this movie better than the original. But this movie introduced new problems that stop it from being better than the original. First off the movie feels like a completely different story. It has the Snow White story in there, but the overall story with the evil queen and Snow White royalty is completely different and just doesn't match the classic that we know. Makes it feel like a completely different movie and that they only put Snow White in this movie so that people went out and saw it. Earlier I did talk about Gal Gadot and how she matched the evil queen almost perfectly with her performance. But her singing sounds awful in here, I never liked the song She's singing in this movie and her performance doesn't help. She's singing in the way that doesn't really match the evil queen. And the song just sounds completely off and the song just feels forced into the movie. I do think the first hour of this movie is really solid, but the second half of the movie is where it started to really go downhill. Partially because that's where the new story comes into play, but it also captured none of the magic that the original Snow White movie had. And the romance just felt forced, it felt like they only had the romance in there just for snow White to wake up from the poison apple. And the CGI dwarfs don't look as bad as they did in the trailer, but they still don't look good. I don't understand why they didn't hire an actual person to play the role instead of the CGI dwarfs. But overall, Snow White still at least captures the same magic that the original classic had, and fixing a lot of my problems that I had of the original movie. But they changed so much of the story that it just doesn't feel like the same movie anymore and feels like a completely different movie, but a boring plot that doesn't capture the same magic that the original movie had.

tt6208148,rw10411566,nuaykuma,A Poisoned Apple: The Tragic Demise of Disney's Snow White (Live Action),"Once upon a time, in a kingdom far removed from common sense and artistic integrity, there lived a studio that had once woven dreams into golden tapestries. But lo, in its latest attempt to refurbish its own legend, Disney has handed us not a gleaming, enchanted mirror but a cracked and smudged pane of mediocrity. Snow White (Live Action) is not merely a failure; it is an affront to storytelling, an exercise in vanity wrapped in the dull silk of corporate ambition.

The film stumbles from its first breath, stripping its own source material of magic and replacing it with a listless script that lacks both charm and coherence. The screenplay reads as though penned by a committee of bureaucrats, each more terrified than the last of offending the fickle winds of public discourse. In their desperation to modernize a beloved tale, they have excised its very soul, leaving behind a corpse as lifeless as the poisoned princess herself.

The characters, once vibrant archetypes of good and evil, are now hollow marionettes, their strings pulled by unseen corporate hands. Snow White, once the embodiment of kindness and innocence, now wanders through the film with all the warmth of a tax audit. The Evil Queen, a figure of operatic wickedness in the original, is reduced to a cardboard villainess whose motivations are as uninspired as the drab CGI that surrounds her. And as for the dwarfs-oh, forgive me, the ""mystical creatures""-they are an insult not just to tradition but to the very concept of character development.

Visually, the film is a testament to the perils of uninspired excess. The color palette is a study in dreariness, the cinematography lifeless, and the special effects a dismal reminder that no amount of digital wizardry can compensate for a lack of vision. The castle may be grand, the forests sprawling, but none of it evokes the whimsy or wonder of the animated classic. Instead, it feels as if we are trudging through a soundstage dressed in dollar-store fantasy.

Then, there is the dialogue-a parade of insipid declarations and clumsy platitudes that drip with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. The film treats its audience not as lovers of fairytales but as a demographic to be placated, spoon-fed platitudes in place of meaningful storytelling.

If Snow White (Live Action) were a magic mirror, it would not tell the Evil Queen she is the fairest of them all; it would shatter out of sheer embarrassment. This is not merely a bad film-it is an act of vandalism against cinema, a joyless, cynical slog that reminds us that, indeed, not all fairy tales have happy endings. And in this case, the only salvation lies in the certainty that time will bury it in the same graveyard where other misguided remakes go to be forgotten.",1.0,2025-03-28,4,0,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

tt6208148,rw10411421,imdbfan-1363577097,Cinematic Catastrophe,"Disney's latest live-action debacle, Snow White (2025), is a cinematic catastrophe that manages to tarnish a timeless classic with an unholy blend of soulless revisionism and visual repugnance. Rachel Zegler, despite her vocal talents, is utterly miscast as a Snow White devoid of charm or depth, sleepwalking through a narrative so aimlessly butchered it feels like a parody of itself. Gal Gadot's Evil Queen is a wooden, over-theatrical disaster, delivering lines with all the menace of a department store mannequin, while the CGI dwarfs-grotesque, uncanny abominations-look like they stumbled out of a rejected video game cutscene. The film's bloated $270 million budget somehow translates into cheap, plasticky sets and costumes that scream ""supermarket Halloween clearance,"" leaving you wondering where the money went-certainly not into creativity or coherence.
This Snow White doesn't just stumble-it belly-flops into a pit of exhaustingly awful decisions, stripping away every ounce of magic from the 1937 original. The screenplay, a muddled mess of half-baked political posturing and lifeless dialogue, replaces romance and wonder with a preachy, self-congratulatory slog that alienates fans and newcomers alike. New songs from Pasek and Paul are forgettable at best, cringe-inducing at worst, while the pacing drags like a funeral march through a forest of gnarled, grasping clichés. It's a film so listless and devoid of heart that it feels like Disney actively despises its own legacy, serving up a steaming pile of corporate cynicism that dares you to stay awake through its joyless runtime.

The acting was cringeworthy. Rachel Zegler was fine, but awkward in many moments. Gal Gadot's acting was atrocious and did not capture any of the original Evil Queen vibes. She did not come off as threatening or possess anything similar to the original, villainous demeanor.
The overall look of this movie wasn't very pleasing to the eye, especially considering the dwarfs were CGI and uncanny looking. Rachel Zegler's appearance as Snow White did not look good at all. The costume was very tacky, poor looking in quality, and seemed like something you could find at a Party City. The Disney parks have better costumes then this movie. Rachel's hair was styled in such a way that her hair looked like it was defying volume and did not resemble snow white whatsoever. Gal gadot's costume also looked off-putting and cheap.
This movie did not seem like Snow White at all, consisting of a plot going in a drastically different direction than the original movie, making many scenes seem out of place, awkward, and/or unnecessary. At some points, I had to remind myself I was watching a remake of snow white and not a random, poor quality movie.
The character development was tasteless, nothing felt enchanting like the original movie did, and this remake sucked out all of the charm of Snow White.
The musical aspect of the movie wasn't terrible, but it definitely couldn't make up for the rest of the trash presented on the big screen.

This movie is less ""fairest of them all"" and more ""fairest at failing upwards."" If you ever wondered what it would look like if someone took the classic 1937 animated masterpiece, ran it through a corporate buzzword generator, and then tossed in some awkward CGI for good measure-congratulations, you've found your answer!

A Princess with a Personality (Kind Of?)

Rachel Zegler takes on the role of Snow White, though you'd be forgiven for thinking she was actually playing a medieval TED Talk speaker. Instead of the wide-eyed, kind-hearted princess we all knew, this Snow White is a Strong Independent Woman™-because saying ""I want to be a queen, not a bride"" apparently counts as character development these days. That's right, folks, forget charming dwarfs, woodland creatures, or actual chemistry with anyone; this Snow White has dreams, and she's here to remind you about them every five minutes.

But despite all that, her biggest challenge in the movie isn't even the Evil Queen-it's keeping the audience awake.

Gal Gadot: Evil Queen or Instagram Influencer?

Now, let's talk about Gal Gadot's Evil Queen. You'd think that playing a narcissistic, beauty-obsessed villain would be an easy fit for Hollywood, but somehow, even with all the pouting, dress-swishing, and over-the-top glowering, she ends up about as menacing as a fashion blogger with a bad attitude.

Her obsession with being ""the fairest of them all"" is laughable when you realize that, well... she already is the fairest of them all. No offense to Snow White, but if the mirror told me that Gal Gadot wasn't the hottest person in the kingdom, I'd be smashing that thing to pieces too. The real villain here is the mirror's manufacturer.

The Dwarfs: Now with 90% Less Dwarfs!

Ah yes, the seven dwarfs-except, surprise! They're not really dwarfs anymore. Instead, we get a diverse group of CGI-enhanced ""magical creatures"" who look like they were rejected from The Lord of the Rings for being too unsettling. Imagine if a bunch of carnival performers got stuck in a blender with bad CGI, and you've got these guys.

Their role in the movie? Mostly to exist, deliver unfunny one-liners, and make you wonder if we should start a petition to bring back actual actors instead of whatever motion-capture madness this is. If I wanted to spend two hours looking at weirdly animated characters, I'd just play a bad video game.

The Apple Fiasco

We all know the story: Evil Queen poisons apple, Snow White eats apple, Snow White falls into a death nap, and then a prince shows up to wake her with true love's kiss. Simple, right? Nope. Not in this version.

Instead, we get a long, drawn-out scene where Snow White almost eats the apple, but then stops to give another speech about believing in yourself or some nonsense. And when she does finally bite it, the whole moment is ruined by some weird slow-motion effects that make it look like an overly dramatic shampoo commercial.

Honestly, I was rooting for the apple at that point. Maybe if she stayed in an enchanted coma, we'd all be spared another unnecessary Disney remake.

Final Verdict: The Fairest Disaster of Them All

This movie is what happens when you take a beloved classic, strip away everything that made it charming, and replace it with corporate-approved ""modernization"" that pleases no one. It's a film that wants to be empowering, but instead feels like a checklist of forced inclusivity and soulless spectacle.

Snow White (2025) is proof that sometimes, it's better to leave well enough alone. If you're looking for magic, wonder, and nostalgia, just rewatch the 1937 version. If you're looking for two hours of your life you'll never get back, then by all means, go ahead and buy a ticket.",1.0,2025-03-21,6894,525,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

From lackluster performances to subpar CGI, this film struggles to capture the magic of the original classic.
Rachel Zegler: A Miscast Lead
Rachel Zegler, who takes on the iconic role of Snow White, delivers a performance that feels stiff and uninspired. While she undeniably has a strong singing voice, her acting lacks the warmth and charm that made the animated Snow White so beloved. Her line delivery often comes off as forced, and she struggles to bring emotional depth to the character. Instead of exuding the innocence and kindness associated with Snow White, her portrayal feels distant and, at times, even disengaged.
Weak CGI and Bland Visuals
For a film with Disney's budget, the CGI is shockingly subpar. The enchanted forest, which should have felt lush and immersive, looks artificial, and the CGI creatures lack the expressiveness and charm of their animated counterparts. The dwarfs-who have been controversially reimagined-look awkward and unnatural, making it hard to emotionally invest in their presence. The visual effects in Snow White feel rushed, and instead of enhancing the experience, they serve as a constant distraction.
Music: Strong Vocals, Forgettable Songs
If there's one aspect where the film slightly shines, it's Zegler's singing. She undeniably has a beautiful voice, and her vocal performances are solid. However, the new songs she's given are bland and unmemorable, failing to capture the whimsy and timeless appeal of the original soundtrack. Unlike Beauty and the Beast or The Little Mermaid, which at least had a few standout musical moments, Snow White's soundtrack feels generic and uninspired.
Conclusion: A Missed Opportunity
Ultimately, Snow White is another soulless live-action remake that lacks the heart and magic of the original. While Zegler's singing is a bright spot, her acting, coupled with bad CGI and uninspired musical numbers, makes this adaptation feel unnecessary. Disney had an opportunity to bring a fresh and captivating take on Snow White, but instead, they delivered a forgettable and lackluster film. Fans of the original will likely leave disappointed, longing for the charm and artistry that made the 1937 classic a masterpiece.",1.0,2025-03-20,5205,498,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

With uninspired performances, weak visuals, and forgettable music, this film serves as a prime example of why not every animated masterpiece needs a live-action remake.
Rachel Zegler: A Snow White Lacking Charm
Casting Rachel Zegler as Snow White seemed like an interesting choice, but unfortunately, her performance falls flat. While her singing ability is undeniable, her acting lacks the warmth and innocence that defined the character. Instead of a sweet and kindhearted princess, this Snow White comes across as distant, and at times, even uninterested in the story unfolding around her. Her line delivery feels forced, and there's little emotional connection between her and the world she's supposed to inhabit.
Dull Visuals & Poor CGI
Disney is known for its stunning animation and groundbreaking CGI, but Snow White (2025) somehow manages to look cheap and unpolished. The enchanted forest, which should have been lush and magical, looks like an over-processed video game backdrop. The CGI dwarfs, which already sparked controversy before release, look awkward and unnatural, making it even harder to connect with them emotionally. Rather than immersing the audience in a fantasy world, the visuals constantly pull you out of the experience.
Music: A Forgettable Soundtrack
The one highlight of the film is Zegler's singing, but even that can't save the uninspired and generic new songs. Unlike Disney's previous live-action adaptations, which at least attempted to reimagine classic melodies, Snow White (2025) fails to create any memorable musical moments. The new songs lack the magic of Someday My Prince Will Come or Heigh-Ho, leaving nothing that audiences will hum after leaving the theater.
Conclusion: Another Failed Remake
Snow White (2025) is a textbook example of how not to remake a beloved film. Instead of enhancing the story, it strips away its charm and replaces it with a lifeless, forgettable adaptation. Disney had the chance to create something special, but what we got instead is yet another uninspired cash grab that fails to justify its existence. Fans of the original will likely leave the theater disappointed and frustrated, once again questioning why Disney insists on remaking its animated classics when the magic clearly isn't there.

tt6208148,rw10411519,freefighter-10764,Honest,"A Disastrous Display of Acting:
It's not often that a film completely falls apart due to the sheer incompetence of its cast, but snow white achieves this unfortunate feat with stunning effectiveness. From the very first scene, it becomes painfully clear that the actors are either woefully miscast, entirely uninterested, or simply incapable of delivering convincing performances. This movie serves as a masterclass in how poor acting can single-handedly ruin an otherwise promising premise.
Wooden Performances and Zero Chemistry
One of the most glaring issues with this film is the complete lack of chemistry between the actors. Whether it's supposed to be a heartfelt romance, an intense rivalry, or a deep friendship, every relationship in this movie feels forced and unnatural. The lead actors, in particular, seem completely disconnected from their characters and each other. Scenes that should have been filled with passion or tension instead feel lifeless, as if the performers are merely reciting their lines without any understanding of their meaning.
It doesn't help that the dialogue is already weak, but even the best script in the world would struggle to shine with such uninspired delivery. Emotional scenes feel robotic, with actors delivering their lines as if they're reading from a teleprompter for the first time. Even when a character is supposed to be devastated, angry, or overwhelmed with joy, the actors fail to convey any genuine feeling. The result is a series of moments that should be powerful but instead induce unintentional laughter or, worse, boredom.
Overacting and Unnatural Expressions
While some members of the cast seem completely detached, others take the opposite approach-overacting to a ridiculous degree. Instead of expressing emotions naturally, these actors resort to exaggerated facial expressions, unnatural pauses, and theatrical gestures that feel more suited to a low-budget soap opera than a feature film. This excessive dramatization completely takes the audience out of the experience, making it impossible to take any scene seriously.
One particularly awful performance comes from main caracter, whose attempts at intensity result in a series of bizarre grimaces and over-the-top line deliveries. Every word feels forced, every gesture unnatural. It's as if they're trying to compensate for their lack of true emotion by pushing everything to an absurd level. Instead of drawing the viewer into the story, their presence makes every scene feel like an awkward high school play.
Supporting Cast: Just as Bad, If Not Worse
If the leads are bad, the supporting cast is even worse. Many side characters serve as nothing more than walking clichés, with actors delivering their lines in the most uninspired and unconvincing ways imaginable. Whether it's a villain who sounds like they're imitating a cartoon bad guy or a best friend character who has zero personality, every performance feels like a failed audition.
There are moments where it seems like some of the actors are aware of how bad the movie is and have simply given up. Instead of trying to bring life to their roles, they lazily go through the motions, making it clear that they're just there for the paycheck. In a movie that desperately needs at least one compelling performance, this level of indifference makes the experience all the more unbearable.
Final Verdict: A Complete Disaster
Even with a weak script and bad direction, a movie can sometimes be saved by strong performances. Unfortunately, snow white has nothing of the sort. The acting is, without a doubt, its biggest downfall, making it impossible to invest in the story or care about any of the characters. With wooden delivery, exaggerated overacting, and zero chemistry, this film stands as a testament to how crucial a talented cast is to a movie's success.
If you're looking for an example of how bad acting can completely destroy a film, look no further. This is a performance disaster from start to finish, and no amount of good cinematography or decent action sequences can make up for it.

I went in curious to see how they'd reimagine the classic, but it kind of missed the mark for me. First off, it didn't feel like Snow White at all. They tried really hard to make it modern and ""different,"" but in doing that, they stripped away everything that made the original story charming and magical. It felt more like they were pushing a message than telling a fairy tale. Not saying stories can't evolve, but this one felt forced.
Rachel Zegler's version of Snow White wasn't relatable or likeable. She came off a bit self-important instead of kind and warm like the Snow White we all know. And where are the dwarfs? They swapped them out for random magical creatures, and it just didn't have the same fun vibe. Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen was probably the best part-she had some great moments-but even she couldn't save it.

Stripping away the heart and soul that made the original a timeless masterpiece, this misguided remake fails to add anything meaningful to the legacy of Walt Disney's work. One can only imagine Walt Disney rolling in his grave at the sight of this soulless adaptation.
Rachel Zegler, portraying Snow White, delivers a performance that lacks warmth and charm-traits that are quintessential to the character. Her portrayal feels distant, disinterested, and forced, with her line delivery devoid of genuine emotion. As a result, the emotional connection between the audience and the protagonist is completely absent, making it hard to root for or even care about Snow White's journey.
The visuals, however, are the sole bright spot in this otherwise dismal production. The efforts of the VFX and CGI teams shine through, demonstrating remarkable skill and attention to detail. It's evident that this aspect of the film received genuine care and hard work from the VFX team, but unfortunately, it cannot carry the weight of an uninspired story and lackluster performances. I do think it would have been better if humans played the dwarves though, since there's a lot of them wanting work in Hollywood.
The soundtrack is equally disappointing, with new songs that fail to capture even a shred of the magic and memorable melodies of the original. Bland, forgettable, and uninspired, the music feels more like a filler than a vital component of the storytelling experience.
One of the most glaring flaws in Snow White (2025) lies in its complete disregard for the original story that made the classic an enduring piece of cinematic history. The charm and simplicity of the original fairy tale have been traded for a heavy-handed attempt to modernize the narrative, resulting in a story that feels disconnected and devoid of the timeless magic that Walt Disney so carefully crafted. What made Snow White a beloved tale for generations was its sincerity, innocence, and universal themes, all of which seem to have been discarded in favor of a hollow, surface-level reinterpretation.
Rather than paying homage to the original characters and their arcs, the new story feels like an attempt to reinvent them in ways that are jarring and unfaithful to the source material. This shift not only alienates fans of the original but also undermines the very essence of what made Snow White's journey resonate so deeply. It's as if the creators prioritized ticking boxes for modern trends over respecting the rich legacy of the original fairy tale.
The performances exacerbate the issue further, as it seems the actors themselves lack respect or understanding for the characters they are portraying. Snow White, a character known for her warmth, kindness, and unwavering optimism, is portrayed with a level of detachment that feels entirely out of place in a fairytale setting. The attempt to inject a new personality into the character comes across as disingenuous, further driving a wedge between the audience and the story.
In many moments, it feels as if the actors are trying to reshape their characters into something unrecognizable, rather than embracing the spirit of the roles they were entrusted with. This disconnect contributes to a sense that the cast and creators view the original material not as a treasured classic to build upon, but as an outdated relic to be replaced. The result is a story and set of performances that fail to capture the heart and whimsy of the fairy tale world.
By disregarding the foundational elements of Snow White, the 2025 remake betrays its source material and its audience. What should have been a celebration of one of Walt Disney's most iconic creations instead feels like a disjointed, half-hearted experiment that strips the tale of its soul. Fans who cherished the original for its timeless simplicity and heartfelt storytelling will find themselves deeply disappointed by this hollow rendition.
In conclusion, Snow White (2025) feels like a cash grab-a lifeless, unnecessary remake that tarnishes the legacy of its predecessor. Fans of the original will undoubtedly find themselves disappointed and questioning Disney's continued reliance on rehashing classic works. If Walt Disney were here to see this, he would undoubtedly be embarrassed by the state of his cherished studio.

From the moment the lights dimmed and the opening scenes unfolded, I was captivated, as was my little one. It's not often that a movie can engage both children and adults equally, but this film managed to do just that, creating a shared experience that was both magical and memorable.
As a parent, I often find myself scrutinizing the content of children's films, wanting to ensure they are suitable, entertaining, and enriching. This movie exceeded all my expectations. Its vibrant visuals and engaging storyline held my child's attention throughout, while also providing enough depth and humor to keep me entertained. The animation and live-action blend was seamless, showcasing Disney's commitment to quality and storytelling. The attention to detail in the production design was remarkable, immersing us in a world that felt both fantastical and relatable.
One of the aspects I appreciated most was the film's message. It conveyed themes of friendship, courage, and perseverance in a way that was accessible to young audiences without being overly simplistic. My child was able to grasp the underlying lessons while also enjoying the fun and adventure that unfolded on screen. This balance is crucial for any children's film, and I felt this one struck it perfectly.
Moreover, the characters were well-developed and relatable. Each character brought something unique to the story, allowing for a range of emotions and experiences that resonated with both children and adults. The performances were stellar, and it was clear that the cast poured their hearts into bringing these characters to life. The dialogue was witty and clever, providing plenty of laughs for people of all ages. My child found themselves giggling at the antics of the characters, while I appreciated the clever wordplay that added a layer of enjoyment for adult viewers.
It's also worth mentioning the music and score of the film. Disney has a long history of creating memorable soundtracks, and this movie is no exception. The songs were catchy and beautifully performed, enhancing the storytelling and uplifting the overall experience. I found myself humming the tunes long after we left the theater, and my child couldn't stop singing along, which is always a good sign of a successful musical element in a film.
I do want to address the mixed reviews that I've seen circulating about this movie. It seems that many of the critics did not give it a fair chance-some may not have even watched it. This is disheartening, as I believe that every film deserves an opportunity to be judged on its own merits. It's important to remember that movies like this are designed to entertain families, and when viewed through that lens, this film truly shines.
In a time when parents are often bombarded with options for family-friendly entertainment, it can be challenging to find those gems that resonate with both children and adults. This film stands out as one of the best live-action movies Disney has produced to date, and I wholeheartedly believe it deserves a spot on your family's watch list.
In conclusion, my experience watching this movie with my child was nothing short of delightful. The captivating visuals, engaging characters, meaningful messages, and catchy music combined to create a truly enchanting film. I cannot recommend it enough to fellow parents and families looking for a fun and heartwarming movie experience. Give it a chance, and I believe you'll find yourselves as enchanted as we were.",10.0,2025-03-30,4,31,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

I don't know what Disney was thinking, but this remake is an insult to the classic Snow White and honestly, to anyone who values good storytelling, acting, or just basic entertainment.
First off, Rachel Zegler as Snow White? Huge mistake. Her performance feels forced, awkward, and honestly, it seems like she doesn't even want to be there. There's no charm, no warmth-just an overwhelming sense that she's reading off a script and waiting for the check to clear. And Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen? Yeah, she looks great, but her performance is so over-the-top it's almost cartoonish. She's not menacing-she's just cringe.
And let's talk about the visuals-Disney had a massive budget, and somehow, this movie still looks like it was shot on a green screen with the cheapest CGI imaginable. The dwarfs? Oh wait-there are no dwarfs. Instead, we get a bunch of random, forgettable side characters that add nothing to the story. It's like Disney went out of their way to make sure nothing about this film resembles what people actually liked about Snow White.
The music? Completely unmemorable. You won't be humming any of these new songs because they sound like they were written by AI on a bad day. Meanwhile, they stripped away the iconic songs from the original because, I don't know, Disney just hates joy now?
And let's not forget the story-it's a mess. They tried to ""modernize"" the plot by making Snow White some kind of girlboss warrior princess who doesn't need a prince, but it's so forced and hollow that it just makes the movie boring. It's not empowering, it's just bad writing.
Overall, this movie is a soulless cash grab that no one asked for. It's not fun, it's not magical, and it certainly doesn't justify its existence. Disney needs to stop with these live-action remakes and actually focus on making new, original films instead of ruining their classics.

Rachel Zegler delivers a good performance, bringing some charm and depth to the character, yet the overall story feels disjointed and lacks the emotional weight of the original. The decision to use CGI dwarfs instead of practical effects or real actors is disappointing, as it removes much of the warmth and personality that made them so memorable. Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen fails to capture the menace and intensity of the original character, with her performance feeling somewhat flat and lacking the gravitas needed to make her a truly compelling villain. While the film is visually stunning, featuring beautiful set designs and vibrant cinematography, its uneven pacing and underwhelming narrative prevent it from making a lasting impact.

tt6208148,rw10412077,imdbfan-0526967414,A Complete Disaster,"Disney's Snow White (2025) is nothing short of a catastrophe. From the moment the first trailer dropped, it was clear that this remake was going to be controversial, but no one could have predicted just how badly it would turn out.
First, let's talk about the writing-or rather, the lack of it. The story abandons the charm and simplicity of the original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and replaces it with a bland, uninspired plot that feels more like a generic fantasy movie than a beloved fairy tale. The dialogue is painfully forced, with characters delivering lines that sound more like modern social commentary than timeless storytelling.
Then, there's the casting. While diverse representation is always welcome when done well, here it feels completely out of place and forced. Rachel Zegler, despite being a talented actress, delivers a lifeless performance as Snow White, lacking the warmth, innocence, and wonder that made the original character so beloved. Meanwhile, the replacement of the dwarfs with generic ""magical creatures"" is another baffling decision that strips the film of its personality.
The visuals are another disappointment. Unlike Cinderella (2015) or Beauty and the Beast (2017), which at least had stunning production design, Snow White (2025) looks surprisingly cheap for a Disney blockbuster. The CGI is inconsistent, the costumes lack the elegance of the original designs, and the overall cinematography feels dull and uninspired.
And then there's the music-or the lack of it. The removal of classic songs like Heigh-Ho and Someday My Prince Will Come is a huge mistake. Instead of giving us memorable melodies, the film settles for forgettable, generic background scores that leave no lasting impression.
Overall, Snow White (2025) is a lifeless, unnecessary remake that no one asked for and even fewer will enjoy. Disney seems more interested in rewriting its own history than respecting the magic that made its classics timeless.

Gal Gadot, miscast as the Evil Queen, chews scenery with the subtlety of a bulldozer. Her campy villainy is neither frightening nor entertaining, merely laughable.
The CGI is a disaster. The ""dwarfs"" are an uncanny valley nightmare, a grotesque mockery of human beings. The lush, vibrant world of the original is replaced by a sterile, CGI-heavy landscape that feels more like a video game than a fairy tale.
The musical numbers are forgettable, the dialogue is cringeworthy, and the pacing is glacial. Snow White is a cinematic abomination that should be avoided at all costs.

tt6208148,rw10397247,NageTopGun,Disney : This is definitely no classic,"Where do I even begin with the disaster that is the new Snow White movie? Watching it felt less like enjoying a cinematic fairytale and more like enduring a painfully long lecture on how not to adapt a classic. This remake somehow manages to strip away everything that made the original magical and replaces it with a hollow, tone-deaf mess filled with arrogance and incompetence.
Let's talk about the cast - or rather, the lack of any meaningful performances. The lead is woefully miscast, coming across as smug and detached from the character she's supposed to embody. There's an off-putting air of superiority that clashes with the humility and warmth you'd expect from Snow White. Instead of charm and sincerity, we get wooden line delivery and expressions that range from disinterest to condescension. The supporting cast isn't much better, with performances that feel like rushed table reads rather than crafted characters. It's as if the film was more focused on checking boxes than telling a story.
Visually, the film tries hard to be edgy and ""modern,"" but it ends up looking like a low-effort cosplay production. The special effects are inconsistent, and the costume design swings wildly between uninspired and downright bizarre. The original story's timeless themes of kindness, courage, and love are replaced with forced messaging that feels less empowering and more preachy.
In the end, this Snow White is an unfortunate example of how studios can butcher a beloved tale by losing sight of what made it resonate in the first place. It's not progressive, it's not inspiring, and it's certainly not entertaining. If this is the future of fairy tale adaptations, count me out.",1.0,2025-03-23,332,65,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

Instead of creating something magical or meaningful, they shove in so many unnecessary changes and heavy-handed messaging that it's just exhausting to sit through. The balance between updating the story and keeping the heart of the original is completely off, making it feel more like a lecture than an actual movie.
Nothing flows naturally, and the lack of coherence makes it hard to care about anything happening on screen. The forced attempts to be modern feel incredibly awkward, and rather than feeling progressive or fresh, it just comes off as hollow and unnatural.

The next she was brave, she didn't go all the way. I thought the singing would be beautiful, but this is a movie, not a stage. The singing with a crooked mouth doesn't have to be that clear.

tt6208148,rw10396376,imdbfan-4256212916,Disney Snow White 2025,"Not great.
Let's just say that you will not be at the edge of your seat. There is no suspense at all at any point Too long and dragged out yet the ending is garbled. It felt like somewhere closer to the end of the second hour the creators said ""Hey, would you look at the time! Certainly time to finish this thing!"" So they did...
In general, the queen was just not scary or evil enough. Snow White was not inspiring enough. Gal Gadot's performance was mediocre at best. Rachel's singing was good but acting lacked authenticity. The ""prince"" who wasn't even a prince was not likable. Just a guy off the street who played his rather confusing role poorly. It is hard to understand why the main characters supposedly fall in love with each other. There wasn't a point when a spark between them is seen. No chemistry whatsoever.
7 dwarfs who, it seems, were supposed to be some magical creatures, which would justifying their grotesque appearance, coexist with actual characters with dwarfism which is odd. Where did both types of ""dwarfs"" come from??
It seems that there is a song at every turn, yet no song is memorable enough. Not to mention Gal cannot sing and yet is given a song to struggle with...

Rather than delivering a menacing, commanding performance, Gadot's portrayal feels forced, as if she's reading lines without any genuine connection to her character. It's as though she believes just looking stern is enough to convince us she's evil, but the flat delivery and lack of depth only make her seem more like a confused villain than the sinister figure we're meant to fear. Her presence, instead of elevating the film, actually drags it down, making you wonder how such a talented actress could fall so short in such a pivotal role.
The character design, the dialogue, and the interactions feel disconnected and shallow, and Gadot doesn't help by underplaying what could've been a campy, exaggerated portrayal. It's not just bad-it's boring. Watching her attempt to hold her own against Snow White is like watching paint dry. If the Evil Queen is supposed to be a complex and captivating character, she's anything but here.

tt6208148,rw10392504,felicity-fairy,A very Mirrored movie with too many mixed messages,"To be fair, I have thought a lot of this movie and found the conclusion that Disney does neither understand the old animated movies nor the original fairy tales.
If you do a twisted fairy tale movie, okay all right, then use a different name, as was done with Frozen or Tangled or ""Mirror, Mirror"" and whatever. Of course, Disney movies are always different, but there is a high responsibility as they are regarded as cultural representation, and as a German, I really want to talk about this controversy. All right, if you need to change the back story of the name Snow White, why not simply introduce a real name. Dwarfs in fairy tales are of course not the same as people with dwarfism, and so the CGI idea with also introducing a human actor with dwarfism (with even a heroic task) could have worked, but removing simply the word dwarf does not help. How odd, as usually Disney is so careful of historical accuracy, there is silence about the obvious German connotations of both 1937 movie and the original tale. Although the love story with a guy called Jonathan is more contemporary elaborated than the insta-meet-cute with her prince, it can not evoke the same emotions as the 1937 movie. CGI animals are cute, but seriously? Snow was already in 1937 a leading lady and strong character, but Walt Disney decided to focus on a decision for love instead of power or ambition, so the political-moral connotations in this new movie are rather more backwarded than they actually are thinking. Although going the safe way with keeping definitely surprisingly many things intact from the 1937 movie, even with an old-fashioned fairy tale book opening and taking something from Cinderella live action - with amazing brightness and cheerfulness, it soon goes away from the old story into a world of reimagining. It makes me think of ""Mirror, Mirror"" with touch of the Disney Robin Hood and Tangled movies (and a bit of the German Simsala Grimm Schneewittchen version!), yet failing to showcase the kindness Snowy is constantly talking about. There could have made better use of the original tales (Brothers Grimm, but also tradition of Ludwig Bechstein, Johann Musäus and Ludwig Albert Grimm). Never much exploring the original characters, but somehow throwing in Jonathan's seven bandits as MIRRORED version to the dwarfs (these were the first version leaked, which turns out not to be the 7 ""dwarfs"",which is a good attempt to keep up a mirror structure of the main Disney couple), but so random named (Bingley?? Norwich??? Why???). Anyway, the music is charming, but reminds with ""let go, let glow"" too much of you know what I mean, also such like a reminiscence ""Waiting on a Miracle"" from Encanto. The spectacular musical scenes are very good, but a big contrast to the quiet cottage-core feeling of the 1937 movie In fact, it's a twisted remix, just like a rock/pop version of a music piece by Mozart. It might be worth as an idea offering enjoyable moments and tunes, but considering it as improvement is insane. Just like Enchanted was already a reimagining of Snow White, this is also another one and should be called in my opinion perhaps ""Mirrored"". An interesting advertisement campaign for the old movie and related products through reverse psychology. Particularly, too many mixed ideas. ""Strong independent"" - but princess -, still not as daring as in Mirror, Mirror, here in a child costume advertisement spot, and let's not forget that girl empowerment does not work this way with an anachronistic understanding of monarchy (Disney Queen franchise?), and let us simply dream, not be lessoned...",1.0,2025-03-21,2414,299,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

The biggest issue? The story. Instead of honoring the beloved original, Disney decided to throw in unnecessary changes that feel forced and out of place. The seven dwarfs, a crucial part of the original charm, are now CGI creations that look awkward and lifeless. And let's not forget the baffling decision to replace the Prince with a new character named Jonathan, who adds absolutely nothing to the plot.
Rachel Zegler's Snow White lacks the grace and warmth of the animated classic, and while her singing is fine, her performance is bland. Meanwhile, Gal Gadot's Evil Queen is disappointingly one-note, lacking the chilling presence that made the animated version so iconic.
Visually, the movie is another letdown. The CGI is overdone, making everything look artificial and lifeless rather than magical. Even the costume design feels cheap compared to previous Disney live-action films.
Overall, Snow White (2025) is a perfect example of why not every classic needs a remake. It strips away the magic, replaces it with uninspired changes, and ultimately turns a beloved fairytale into a forgettable mess. If you're looking for nostalgia or a worthy reimagining, this isn't it.

Disney's decision to cast Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen in the Snow White remake is a complete misstep. The role demands a truly commanding and sinister presence-someone who can embody the Queen's ruthless obsession with beauty and power. Instead, they chose an actress whose performances often feel flat and unconvincing, lacking the depth needed for such an iconic villain.
The Evil Queen is supposed to be chilling, her mere presence sending shivers down the audience's spine. Yet, with this casting, it's hard to imagine anything other than a bland and uninspired portrayal. Her delivery lacks the dramatic weight necessary to make the Queen a truly memorable antagonist. This choice feels lazy, as if Disney simply prioritized star power over actually finding someone who fits the role.
On top of that, her voice alone is a huge issue. The Evil Queen's voice should be commanding and filled with authority, yet here, it will likely feel weak and unthreatening. This role deserved someone with theatrical gravitas, not someone who struggles to bring depth to their performances. Ultimately, this casting decision is yet another sign that Disney is more interested in stunt casting than staying true to what makes Snow White a classic.",1.0,2025-03-26,5,0,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

tt6208148,rw10390888,iltonysverbel,A Failed Attempt to Reinvent a Classic,"When Walt Disney released Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937, it was not merely the first full-length animated feature film; it set a golden standard for animation and fantastical storytelling. That masterpiece, with its technical innovation, emotional depth, and ability to captivate audiences of all ages, became a cultural beacon. Nearly a century later, the new Snow White (2025) had the opportunity to honour that legacy, to build upon the shoulders of that giant. Instead, it chose to spit in its face, renounce its essence, and deliver a reinterpretation that, far from being bold or refreshing, feels flat, soulless, and ultimately unnecessary.

From the outset, the project was plagued by ill-advised statements and questionable creative decisions. Rachel Zegler, the actress cast as Snow White, was quick to distance herself from the original material. In interviews, she declared, ""We're not in 1937 anymore, and we're making a film where the princess isn't saved by the prince, nor does she dream of true love."" She later added, ""The original scared me. I think I watched it once and never again. I'm serious"" (source: Entertainment Weekly). These statements, rather than signalling a bold new direction, come across as dismissive of the work that inspired this new version. While modernising a classic tale is a valid endeavour, doing so with arrogance and disdain for the source material is a grave misstep.

Directed by Marc Webb, known for his work on 500 Days of Summer and The Amazing Spider-Man, the film underwent multiple reshoots and script changes, resulting in an inconsistent tone and a disjointed narrative. Webb, a director with a knack for emotional intimacy and visual aesthetics, appears to have been swept up by the demands of a studio unsure of what it wanted from this project. The result is a film devoid of its own identity, caught between the need to pay homage to the classic and the desire to deconstruct it.

One of the most glaring issues with Snow White (2025) is its lack of soul. The film feels like a manufactured product, designed by committee, devoid of the passion or artistic vision that could have elevated it. Rachel Zegler, despite her undeniable vocal talent (evidenced by her brilliant debut in West Side Story), fails to imbue Snow White with the depth or charisma needed to connect with the audience. Her songs, while technically flawless, lack the magic and memorability that defined the 1937 classic. There is no ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" here, no melody that lingers in the mind.

The visual design, meanwhile, is a double-edged sword. Marc Webb opted for a warm colour palette that, while aesthetically pleasing in moments, ultimately becomes tiresome and clashes with scenes that demand a darker, more sombre tone. The film seems unable to decide whether it wants to be a luminous fairy tale or a gothic fable, and this indecision is reflected in its uneven aesthetic.

One of the most controversial elements is the reinterpretation of the Magic Mirror. In this version, the mirror not only lies but seems to harbour a disdain for its owner, the Evil Queen (played by Gal Gadot). The idea that the mirror declares Rachel Zegler to be ""the fairest of them all"" is, at best, laughable. It is not that Zegler is unattractive, but the direct comparison to Gadot, whose on-screen presence is nothing short of dazzling, renders the mirror's proclamation utterly unconvincing. Speaking of Gadot, while her acting performance is solid, her foray into singing is, regrettably, disastrous. Her voice, lacking the necessary power and technique, ruins what could have been pivotal moments in the film.

The narrative pacing is another weak point. The film oscillates between scenes that rush forward, leaving no time for emotional connection, and moments that stagnate in unnecessary details. Snow White's childhood, for instance, is an insufferable segment, poorly written and even more poorly executed, adding nothing to the main plot.

In summary, Snow White (2025) is a textbook example of how not to reinvent a classic. In its eagerness to be modern and progressive, the film loses sight of what made the original story so timeless: its heart, its magic, and its ability to connect with the deepest parts of our humanity. What remains is an empty product, devoid of the spark that ensured the 1937 classic would endure in collective memory.

The story felt overly changed, losing the charm of the original. While Rachel Zegler gave a decent performance as Snow White, Gal Gadot's Evil Queen lacked depth and didn't leave much of an impression.

tt6208148,rw10415239,imdbfan-5888938320,Gal Gadot's Laughable Performance Ruins the Evil Queen,"I went into the *Snow White* remake hoping for at least one redeeming quality, but Gal Gadot's performance as the Evil Queen made that impossible. In what should have been a commanding, chilling, and elegant portrayal of one of Disney's most iconic villains, Gadot instead delivers a performance that is so forced and awkward that it completely takes you out of the film.
Zero Presence, Zero Threat
The Evil Queen is supposed to be a menacing figure-sophisticated yet terrifying, with a presence that dominates every scene. Instead, Gadot comes across as someone playing dress-up rather than embodying the role. Her attempt at regal authority falls flat, as she lacks the charisma and depth needed to make the Queen compelling. Instead of exuding power, she simply looks bored, like she's reading lines off a teleprompter.
Forced and Unconvincing Line Delivery
One of the biggest problems is her delivery. Every line feels overly rehearsed yet still unnatural, as if she's unsure whether she should be menacing or dramatic. The way she stretches out her words in an attempt to sound intimidating only makes her performance feel cartoonish. She doesn't command attention; instead, she makes the Queen feel like a parody of herself.
Her voice, which normally works well in action roles, doesn't suit the character here. The original Evil Queen had a deep, commanding tone that sent chills down your spine. Gadot's version lacks weight, and her exaggerated enunciation makes her sound like she's trying way too hard. The Queen should be effortlessly terrifying-not someone struggling to sound sinister.
Over-the-Top Yet Emotionless Acting
Somehow, Gadot manages to be both over-the-top and completely emotionless at the same time. Her exaggerated expressions and awkward gestures make it clear that she's trying to act ""evil,"" but it never feels natural. Instead of embodying the role, she seems like she's in a school play, overacting without understanding the character's true essence.
The famous ""Mirror, Mirror on the wall"" scene, which should be chilling, ends up being laughable. Gadot's delivery is so stilted that it's impossible to take her seriously. There's no underlying malice, no quiet fury-just a forced attempt at being dramatic. Even when she plots Snow White's downfall, there's no real emotion behind her words. It's as if she's just going through the motions, rather than truly embracing the character's wickedness.
A Villain Without Depth
The worst part is that the Queen, one of Disney's most iconic villains, ends up feeling flat and unmemorable. There's no nuance, no subtlety, and no real menace. The Queen's descent into obsession and jealousy is what makes her so compelling, but Gadot's performance completely misses this complexity. She doesn't come across as a cunning and dangerous ruler-just an actress who isn't suited for the role.
Final Verdict
Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen is one of the biggest reasons this remake fails. Instead of giving us a villain with gravitas and menace, she delivers a laughably bad performance that lacks depth, emotion, and credibility. If you want to see a truly terrifying Evil Queen, just rewatch the original animated *Snow White*. This version isn't worth your time.",1.0,2025-03-29,5,0,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

tt6208148,rw10392287,Alatheary0p,"They reinvented the fairy tale (for better or worse), while keeping just enough of the original to feel familiar.","Rachel Zegler plays a more self-reliant Snow White, who isn't just waiting for a prince but actively shaping her own destiny. Andrew Burnap's Jonathan takes his place as a new love interest, though their relationship is more of a slow burn than a fairy-tale romance.

Gal Gadot's Evil Queen meets a completely different fate. Instead of falling off a cliff, she's trapped in her own enchanted mirror, forced to watch as Snow White thrives.

Waiting on a Wish is Snow White's big solo, replacing Someday My Prince Will Come, making it clear she's dreaming of a future she builds herself. A Hand Meets a Hand, her duet with Jonathan, hints at romance but keeps things ambiguous.

Visually, the film is breathtaking, but its biggest controversy will be the CGI dwarfs. This creative choice may divide audiences, but it leans into the film's more mystical, nature-focused tone.

I grew up with the original, so I was ready to be annoyed at all the changes, but somehow, they work. If you're going in expecting a frame-for-frame remake, this isn't it.

tt6208148,rw10425878,imdbfan-5482608642,Abysmal,"A Deeply Disappointing Experience - Snow White Fails on Every Level
I had high expectations for Snow White, given its classic status, but I was utterly disappointed. This film is a complete disaster from start to finish. The story is painfully simplistic, lacking any real depth or engagement. Snow White herself is one of the most frustratingly dull protagonists I have ever seen. She spends most of the film either singing in a grating, high-pitched voice or being completely helpless. Her character has no personality beyond being nice and naïve, making it impossible to root for her.
The dwarfs, while mildly entertaining, are little more than one-note caricatures. Their only defining traits are their names, and they contribute almost nothing of value to the plot. The Evil Queen is the only remotely interesting character, but even she is underwhelming. Her motivations are flimsy, and her plan is laughably weak. A poisoned apple? That's the best she could come up with?
The animation, while impressive for its time, looks extremely outdated today. The colors are dull, the character movements are awkward, and the backgrounds feel lifeless. Compared to modern animation, Snow White is unbearably slow and visually unimpressive. The pacing is dreadful, with long, unnecessary musical sequences that make the film feel like an endurance test rather than entertainment.
Speaking of music, the songs are forgettable at best and irritating at worst. ""Heigh-Ho"" is repetitive to the point of madness, and ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" is so sickeningly sweet that it feels like a parody. None of the songs add anything of value to the film, and they just make the already sluggish pacing even worse.
To top it all off, the ending is one of the most unsatisfying I've ever seen. Snow White ""dies,"" only to be revived by a completely undeserved and unrealistic kiss from a prince who has barely been in the film. There is zero emotional payoff, and it feels like the movie just rushes to the finish line with no real resolution.
Overall, Snow White is an outdated, boring, and irritating film that has not stood the test of time. If you're looking for a good animated movie, there are countless better options. Avoid this one unless you want to be completely disappointed.",1.0,2025-04-01,16,5,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

Why i'm use words "" A Live action Disney Folly"". Compared to the original version, Snow White and the Seven dwarfs animated version is better than the remakes. Disney has continued to prove that live-action remakes of classic animated tales are getting tiresome and unoriginal. As Gold Member of D23, rachel zegler is the one who blame with, she's disrespecting the movie ever since she put her mouth at the D23 Expo 2 years ago and i'm tired of being humbled I'm tired to be speechless, if Walt is alive, he'll fire her for good.
Besides The Jungle Book and Pete's Dragon remake being pretty good, the other remakes have remained dull, baffling, or offensive and even worse, disrespecting the original animate movie. Snow White is one of those dull ones Absolute horrid . Covered with excessive usages of CGI and colors, the camerawork, production style and colors feel bloated and unsocial.
Alongside with the bland direction, uninteresting takes of how they tell the tale and where the characters were once beloved in the animated movie, becomes lifeless and uninteresting here. The choice of using CGI dwarfs really was a bad idea because it came off as quite uncanny and unintentionally creepy to observe at times.
The performances....aren't very great. Rachel Zegler does give her best as she does have solid moments including some of the voice performances from the other cast. Gal Gadot, however, her performance really didn't work at all. Gadot lacks the emotion and creep charm to what the Evil Queen should have been. Queen should have been.
Rachel Zegler: A Snow White Lacking Charm Casting Rachel
Zegler as Snow White seemed like an interesting choice, but unfortunately, her performance falls flat. While her singing ability is undeniable, her acting lacks the warmth and innocence that defined the character. Instead of a sweet and kindhearted princess, this Snow White comes across as distant, and at times, even uninterested in the story unfolding around her. Her line delivery feels forced, and there's little emotional connection between her and the world she's supposed to inhabit.
Weak CGI and Bland Visuals:
For a film with Disney's budget, the CGI is shockingly subpar.
The enchanted forest, which should have felt lush and immersive, looks artificial, and the CGI creatures lack the expressiveness and charm of their animated counterparts.
The dwarfs-who have been controversially reimagined-look awkward and unnatural, making it hard to emotionally invest in their presence. The visual effects in Snow White feel rushed, and instead of enhancing the experience, they serve as a constant distraction.
Music: A Forgettable Soundtrack The one highlight o film is Zegler's singing, but even that can't save the uninspired and generic new songs. Unlike Disney's previous
Despite some good looking designs on the backgrounds and all, it was really boring. Marc Webb tries his best but unfortunately, really little about this would ever work.
Please, audiences for gods sake. Stop giving the remakes a chance. Save the money and go watch Snow White and the seven dwarfs (1937) instead of the live action Disney folly.

The kind of movie where you check your phone a million times, hoping it's almost over. It drags so much that whatever magic the story was supposed to have just gets lost.
And the acting? Way too over the top. The leads don't just act-they overact like they're in some cringey school play. But the real disaster here? Rachel Zegler. Her performance is flat, forced, and completely unlikable. She delivers her lines like she's too good for the role, but at the same time, she's giving zero personality. It's like watching someone who doesn't even believe in the movie they're in. Instead of being a charming and relatable Snow White, she comes off as annoying and disconnected.
But the worst part? It doesn't connect with anyone. Kids won't care because it's not fun or exciting, and the OG Disney fans? Yeah, they'll probably hate it too because it strays so far from what made the classic special. It's stuck in this weird limbo where it tries to be different but ends up being forgettable.
The only thing that kind of works is the CGI on the dwarfs. It's not mind-blowing, but at least it doesn't look completely awful. Too bad the rest of the movie drags it down.

tt6208148,rw10391655,Aman_Goyal,"Snow White, the movie and not character, having identity crisis","First, let me quote Ansu Kabia's review:
>That the audience for **Ari Aster**'s folk horror might find more pleasure in this Snow White than the average child is telling, since it's almost impossible to work out who this version of the story is aimed at. Children will be bored, teens talked down to, and most adults will wonder where their Snow White is.
Exactly. Who is the target audience of this movie, I couldn't discern. Perhaps the so-called theatre kids, but definitely not kids or adults. Here's my full review:
* First, ***SUBSTANCE***: The tale of** Snow White** is inherently flawed and lacks substance, and despite going rebellious this version couldn't circumvent those weaknesses let alone translating them for better. Worsening on the other hand, well...
* Now, ***VISUALS***? Too vibrant and glistening. The CGI is the biggest enemy in here because it's not disguised properly, and I'm not even going to talk about the catastrophe, that is the thing that happened with little people. The forest, animals, all those wooden houses, kingdom, grass, trees, plant - they are cartoonish, imagine how the special effects looked during ***Lord of the Rings***' era and then increase the saturation and contrast - that bad. It's flabbergasting that they did not go with the darker visuals as seen in the **1937 version** where no flamboyant yellow and green was needed. I take it they wanted to push some kind of ""joy"" based agenda here... I don't know. But the effects don't even match ***Beauty and the Beast*** and that thing came out 8 yrs ago. Maybe, Disney really isn't lying about the budget; maybe the budget really is under $300 million.
* Next ***ACTING***: **Rachel Zegler** can sing alright, and that's the only thing I can find positive to say about her. She's clearly s theater actress and the melodrama shows and gets annoying. That hairstyle isn't helping, and of course, the dress of Snow White makes her appear worse somehow. It's inexplicable, yet conspicuous. **Gal Gadot**, on the other hand, is really not given adequate character. She's an average actress, something we have known all along, but this appearance in here was laughably bad.
* Finally, ***STORY & DIRECTION***: The sloppy themes of leadership are laughable and you can clearly see **Greta Gerwig**'s work there, who was later replaced. Like ***Barbie***, this film go to extreme lengths to reiterate that ***Snow White*** would be a better leader, like Barbies and women in *Barbie*, but like that film it never corroborates that fact by answering ""why would that be?"" We have seen grittier version in ***Snow White and the Huntsman***, and honestly even that was not this bad. The problem is again these visuals and all the musical numbers really not helping.
Lastly, a note to director **Marc Webb**: i love your work in '***The Amazing Spider-Man***' franchise and I loved '***500 Days of Summer***' and I appreciated '***Gifted***,' but you need to stay away from reboots. People weren't happy with *TASM* coming out even though it was a brilliantly darker retelling, but '***Snow White***' just isn't it.
Of course, what's done is done, but let's not remake '***Kimi no Na Wa***.' okay, that thing is too knew for remakes, anyways, and Hollywood's butchery will not sit well there. If you thought this so-called ""right-wing"" backlash was bad, you ain't seen anime fans' fury yet.
So yeah, ***Snow White*** = not worth a watch, hype, or budget; hate and boycott on the other hand...
Not sure it's for kids, definitely not for adults.",1.0,2025-03-21,32,17,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0
tt6208148,rw10393740,kennull,Cgi dwarves in a real life reimagined classics? What could go wrong,"CGI Dwarfs: A Paradox of Technical Showmanship and Emotional Disconnect
The film replaces the iconic seven dwarfs with cartoonish CGI-generated figures, a decision widely condemned as a ""grotesque patchwork of cultural industry clichés"" .Worse, the dwarfs' design-trapped in an unsettling ""human-but-not-human"" limbo-erases the endearing whimsy of their animated counterparts. Over-reliance on flashy effects (e.g., ""magic-hour lighting"") further cheapens their presence, rendering them visually artificial. This obsession with technology reflects Disney's fundamental misunderstanding: the dwarfs are not mere fairy-tale tropes but vessels of humanized emotion. CGI's overuse strips them of this vital connection.
Snow White's flaws reflect Disney's recurring sins in live-action remakes: prioritizing technological spectacle and forced modern messaging over storytelling. When the magic mirror struggles to name ""the fairest,"" Disney should ask itself: true magic lies not in CGI dazzle but in reigniting the pure emotional resonance of fairy tales.

Unfortunately, the experience confirmed the negative buzz and then some. A nearly empty theater set the tone for the experience. Ten minutes into the film, I could tell this was clearly a project more at home on television than the big screen, even if that.
The storyline felt disjointed and choppy. Key character arcs, particularly those involving the seven bandits, were left with glaring, unresolved gaps. One scene even had Snow White distracting pursuing soldiers by revealing a dress-only to find she was still wearing her familiar costume. Such moments only added to the film's overall sense of inconsistency.
Another problematic aspect was the evolution of the mirror on the wall. Initially, it famously declared the queen to be ""the fairest of them all,"" but by the film's end, it shifted its message entirely to one of inner beauty-a dramatic turn that felt both abrupt and unearned. Even the iconic moment of true love's kiss fell flat; lacking any buildup or emotion, it was decidedly anticlimactic and disappointing.
Perhaps the only entertainment value came from the opportunity to roast the film.

Between the controversy surrounding the casting, the drastic changes to the classic story, and the mixed performances, it feels like another case of a remake nobody asked for. Instead of capturing the timeless magic of the original, this adaptation seems to have lost its charm in an attempt to modernize a beloved tale. The visuals may be stunning, but that can't make up for weak writing and uninspired direction. The heart and soul of Snow White are missing, leaving audiences with a forgettable and unnecessary remake. The absence of the iconic dwarfs, the forced political undertones, and the lackluster chemistry between the lead characters make this one of Disney's weakest live-action adaptations to date. It's yet another example of a studio trying too hard to reinvent a story that was already perfect as it was. 1/10.",1.0,2025-03-28,4,0,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

There could have been different things, such as the dwarves, but I think that overall it's not as terrible as people say.
They wanted to change the idea of the story to make it an example for today's generation, without idealizing as usual the princess saved by the prince and who only seeks true love, but a princess who in addition to finding the right person for her (who is not a prince and I think it is more inclusive as a thing to demonstrate that a good character is enough to fall in love) claims her kingdom and finds peace in the people, bringing back happiness, food and wealth to all not only economically but also psychologically.",7.0,2025-03-29,0,3,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

If Disney wanted to completely strip Snow White of its charm, heart, and soul, then congratulations - mission accomplished.
First of all, the script feels like it was written by a committee of people who have never seen a fairy tale, much less understood one. The dialogue is cringe-worthy, the pacing drags endlessly, and the ""modern updates"" feel more like awkward virtue signaling than actual storytelling.
Snow White herself is barely recognizable - not just in appearance, but in character. She's cold, preachy, and somehow manages to have zero chemistry with anyone else on screen. I wasn't rooting for her. I was begging for the end credits. And don't even get me started on the dwarfs... or rather, the random collection of ""diverse companions"" who seem thrown together at the last minute with no clear purpose other than to check boxes.
Visually? Flat. Dull. Lifeless. For a film that's supposed to be a fantasy, there's absolutely no magic. The CGI looks like it was done on a budget of $15 and a YouTube tutorial.
Disney has taken a beloved story and twisted it into something unrecognizable, joyless, and completely out of touch. If this is the future of reimaginings, count me out.

Rachel Zegler, in a role that many actresses would have given anything to play, delivers a shockingly dull and uninspired performance as Snow White.

tt6208148,rw10411576,imdbfan-1986523650,Not for us,"The new live-action Snow White is a spectacular failure, offering nothing but disappointment for fans of the beloved classic. What should have been a nostalgic yet fresh retelling of the iconic fairy tale turns into a convoluted, tone-deaf mess that fails to capture the magic of the original.
First, the casting feels out of place. Rachel Zegler's Snow White seems miscast, offering little charm or depth to the character. Her portrayal lacks the innocence and warmth that made Snow White so beloved in the animated classic. Meanwhile, the decision to make Snow White an activist figure-an odd update in a story where the original focus was on innocence and purity-feels forced and disconnected from the source material.
The script is riddled with cringe-worthy dialogue, stripping away any sense of wonder in favor of unnecessary modern political commentary. The dwarfs, too, are given an awkwardly reworked treatment. The attempt to diversify their portrayal does not feel genuine but instead seems like a box-checking exercise. The result is a group of characters who neither add to the story nor bring the fun and charm they were meant to.
The visual effects, which should have been a saving grace, fall flat. While there are some striking landscapes, much of the film is bogged down by overreliance on CGI that looks cheap and artificial. This cheapens the experience and fails to create the sense of enchantment that Disney's live-action films often evoke. The dark, drab color palette further adds to the lackluster atmosphere.
The biggest disappointment, however, is the overall tone of the film. The once-whimsical world of Snow White is now an unrecognizable, gloomy place. The whimsical magic of the forest, the joy of Snow White's connection with nature, and the warm charm of the original film are replaced by a hollow, soulless world that doesn't inspire the same emotional connection. The pacing is sluggish, with moments of humor and heart nowhere to be found.
In conclusion, Snow White (2025) is a complete misfire. It fails to capture the heart of the original while trying-unsuccessfully-to update the story for a modern audience. It's a movie that misses the mark on every level, from casting to script, direction, and visual execution. Disney's attempt at reimagining a classic turns into a dull and frustrating experience, leaving fans of the original film wishing they'd left well enough alone.",1.0,2025-03-28,4,0,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

Zegler's Snow White lacks the warmth and charm of the 1937 original, coming off as stiff and emotionally flat. Her attempt to modernize the character with an empowered edge feels forced and unnatural, while her singing, though technically strong, lacks soul and fails to elevate the forgettable new songs.

First, let's talk about the lead performance-bland, emotionless, and utterly forgettable. The actress playing Snow White lacks the charm, warmth, and charisma needed for the role. Instead of a strong and endearing heroine, we get a character who feels detached from the world around her.
The CGI? A nightmare. The creatures and backgrounds look artificial, like something from a cheap video game. The dwarfs (or lack thereof) are a complete misfire, removing one of the most iconic elements of the original. Instead, we get a bizarre, soulless attempt at modernizing the story that just falls flat.
And let's not forget the script-awkward, preachy, and devoid of any real heart. Instead of capturing the whimsy and timelessness of the original, the movie hammers audiences with heavy-handed messaging that feels more like a lecture than a fairy tale. The villain? Uninspired. The songs? Unmemorable. The pacing? An absolute slog.
Disney has officially lost its magic with this one. If you loved the original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, do yourself a favor-skip this soulless cash grab and rewatch the classic instead.

Her performance is the theatrical equivalent of cardboard dipped in glitter - all shimmer, zero substance. Every line delivery is painfully stiff, devoid of depth or nuance. She doesn't command the screen; she awkwardly stumbles through it. The Evil Queen is supposed to be a character brimming with venom and complexity. Gadot gives us none of that. Instead, we're treated to a cringeworthy parade of exaggerated expressions and flat intonation, as if she's reading her lines for the first time at a table read.
It's hard to overstate how much she drags down the film. Scenes meant to be intense or emotionally charged land with a thud, thanks to her lifeless presence. Her portrayal is not only unconvincing - it's distracting. You can almost feel the supporting cast trying to act around her, like they're desperately trying to salvage some kind of emotional weight from a performance that gives them absolutely nothing in return.
There are plenty of things wrong with this film - from its soulless visual effects to the uninspired changes to the original story - but Gal Gadot's performance is undoubtedly the worst offense.

1. Snow White dress: looks like a cheap knockoff or a cosplay, the sleeves, the white socks, the excessively bright colors, just looks awful.
2. The digital dwarfs: horrible design , looks out of place, they tried and failed.
3. The main cast: I think Rachel Ziegler is very talented, she can act and she can sing, but she definitely was miscasted for this role, she looks like a parody, talent is not enough when you are forcing into character. Gal Gadot is very limited with her acting resources. I agree she looks amazing, but this is above her skills.
3 things I liked:
1. The songs: I feel this being a musical works perfectly and the new songs were great additions.
2. The scenarios and ambient: the castle, the town, the woods, the cabin, I really liked all of that, it feels out of the original, very fairy tale,
3. The story: I don't get the hate, but the story works. The changes are minimal and not relevant to make it bad, it's a different approach and I genuinely believe they give a different perspective to the take.

The pacing is awkward, the plot feels paper-thin, and the characters are so underdeveloped it's almost insulting. Snow White herself is less of a protagonist and more of a decorative object being moved around the story with zero agency. It's hard to root for someone who barely seems aware of what's happening around her.
The humor doesn't land, the dialogue is painfully simplistic, and the dwarfs-while iconic in name-are just cartoonish stereotypes with no real depth. I understand this was a product of its time, but that doesn't excuse how flat and dull everything feels. Even the villain, who should be a highlight, is reduced to melodramatic overacting and weak motivations.
Visually, it's dated-which is expected-but even so, the animation doesn't hold up in a way that compensates for the movie's many flaws. I wasn't expecting Pixar-level polish, but I was hoping for at least some sense of magic or charm. Instead, it felt like a chore to get through.
If this is considered a classic, it's only because of historical significance-not quality.

tt6208148,rw10411967,imdbfan-3904000435,Snow White is very boring,"Disney's Snow White (2024): A Joyless, Soulless Trainwreck
Disney has done it again-taken a beloved classic and butchered it beyond recognition. The latest Snow White live-action remake is not only a failure as a film but also a complete insult to its source material. It strips away everything that made the original 1937 masterpiece iconic, replacing it with a dull, uninspired, and utterly joyless attempt at a ""modernized"" fairy tale. If you were hoping for a nostalgic retelling with stunning visuals, compelling characters, and heartfelt storytelling, you're in for a massive disappointment.
An Unlikable, Hollow Snow White
Let's start with the biggest problem-Snow White herself. The original Snow White was a kind-hearted, graceful, and gentle character who embodied innocence and optimism. This new version? She's cold, self-righteous, and completely lacking in charm. Instead of being a princess who inspires others with kindness, she is reimagined as a tough, independent leader who seems to look down on the very concept of a fairy tale romance.
Disney clearly wanted to push a ""modern"" version of Snow White, but in doing so, they completely erased what made her an endearing and timeless character. The worst part? The lead actress openly dismissed the original film and its themes in interviews, making it obvious that neither she nor the filmmakers had any respect for the story they were remaking. How are audiences supposed to connect with a character who seems to resent the very movie she's starring in?
Where's the Magic? Where's the Fun?
One of the most tragic aspects of this remake is its complete lack of magic and wonder. The original film was full of whimsy, from the charming dwarfs to the hauntingly beautiful Evil Queen. This version, however, is dull, lifeless, and visually uninspired.
The seven dwarfs, some of the most iconic characters in Disney history, have been all but erased, replaced with a bizarre group of ""magical creatures"" that lack any personality or charm. Their humor, heart, and unique personalities are gone, leaving nothing but generic, forgettable side characters that no one will remember five minutes after the credits roll.
Even the Evil Queen, one of Disney's most iconic villains, has been watered down. Instead of being a terrifying, vain, and manipulative villain, she's just another standard ""jealous queen"" character with no real presence or depth. Her sinister elegance and memorable lines are absent, making her feel like an afterthought rather than the driving force of the story.
A Complete Betrayal of the Classic Story
Disney has taken a timeless fairy tale and stripped it of everything that made it resonate with audiences for nearly a century. The romance? Gone. The dwarfs? Erased. The heartwarming themes of kindness and perseverance? Replaced with forced modern messaging. What remains is a film that feels more like a generic fantasy adventure rather than an actual retelling of Snow White.
The most frustrating part is that this was entirely unnecessary. If Disney wanted to tell a different story, they could have created a brand-new fairy tale rather than butchering a classic. Instead, they decided to slap the Snow White name onto something that has nothing in common with the beloved original.
Final Verdict: A Total Disaster
At this point, Disney's live-action remakes have become predictable disasters, and Snow White is just another casualty. With an unlikable protagonist, a lifeless story, and a complete disregard for the charm of the original, this film is a soulless cash grab with nothing of value to offer.
If you're a fan of the classic Snow White, avoid this movie at all costs. It does nothing but tarnish a beloved story while failing to offer anything worthwhile in return. Watch the original instead-it's a masterpiece that doesn't need ""modernization"" to remain magical.",1.0,2025-03-28,57,12,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

I genuinely didn't expect her to be the weak link, but her performance felt undercooked and surprisingly rookie for someone of her experience. It lacked the depth and presence you'd hope for, especially given the iconic role she was playing.
Then there's the scenery-or rather, the lack of it. It felt lazy and uninspired, like they cut corners on the visuals that are supposed to give fairy tales their magic. The sets didn't pull you into the world; they pushed you out of it.
And don't even get me started on the costume design. It was oddly offbeat, almost like the characters were wearing outfits from a different movie entirely. The clothing lacked that timeless, fantastical charm and instead came across as cheap or hastily thrown together.
Overall, it just didn't click. It's disappointing when a classic like Snow White gets a retelling that misses the mark on all the fundamentals-acting, visuals, and atmosphere.",1.0,2025-03-23,69,15,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

What can I say about this? First off, the OG Snow White wasn't really my cup of tea but then, it wasn't aimed at people like me but I still appreciate what it represents and it's cultural significance.
I'm well aware of all of the controversy surrounding the film and it's 'star' but I tried to give a go and take it for what it is.
It's trash.
The effects are awful, everything looks like it's drenched in some kind of yellow filter and it gives you a headache after about half an hour. I don't need to mention the dwarves as they've been memed to death by this point, they're nightmare inducingly bad. Although I will admit, some of the CGI animals were kind of cute.
Some of the acting is woeful, especially from Gal Gadot who I genuinely like but she's horribly miscast here. I felt genuinely sorry for her.
The story feels like it's been cobbled together from multiple different scrips, it almost feels like several different films stitched together and it's jarring. Most of it feels off and weirdly incoherent.
Shockingly, the one aspect of the film I thought I'd hate the most (as I can not stand the woman) was Rachel Zegler, but I didn't. She's actually not bad in the role and one thing is sure, she can't half sing. She's probably the best thing in this turkey and that shocks me to say.
The songs (though well sung) are terrible, the music is typical Disney live action remake fluff, full of huge orchestral and over the top melodies that just make you cringe.
It's just a mess of a film that shouldn't have been remade. It's has very few redeeming qualities and I couldn't wait for it to end, oh and as for the ending, i won't spoil it but it's as anti climactic as it gets, I was genuinely shocked at how it wrapped up, I was like 'Really? Somebody wrote that and it passed through several script doctors and producers' Wait until you see it, it's laughable.
I hate this film, it's one of the worst cinema experiences I've had but I owed it to my partner.

Rachel Zegler's Snow White lacks the warmth and innocence that made the character iconic, and the film's attempt to turn her into a strong and independent leader feels forced and out of place. The dwarfs have been controversially reimagined in a way that removes their personality, and the absence of a real Prince entirely erases one of the story's core elements. Meanwhile, Gal Gadot's Evil Queen, while visually striking, delivers a performance that is more stale than menacing.

Vibrato Instability.
I listened to Ms Zegler and Mrs Gadot singing and in both I had moments that you shouldn't have in a Disney film.
I flinched at the singing where in certain points, the actresses voices went off-key or warbled enough that it was distinctly noticeable.
And while I think that an actress who does present themselves as a singer is someone I can forgive for warbly singing or clunky attempts at pitch. When you're one who styles herself as being able to sing, making your - admittedly very small - audience flinch at those flat notes, off-keys and screeching vocals is not something you want to do.
I understand that hitting the high note is something any singer would want to do, and that nominally it's something that a good singer can do, but really Disney... was it that hard to get multiple takes of this song to mix them together so that you don't end up making your audience think it's a Jump Scare Sting?",1.0,2025-03-28,4,0,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

tt6208148,rw10414440,Canadian_Amateur_Film_Dude,All the Motions of the Original; Without the Meaning,"To understand the major issues with this remake, we must first understand what the meaning behind the story of Snow White is.
Snow White is a story about beauty and vanity. It is an assessment of the human condition and how obsession with appearances can lead to your demise.
The Queen is the ""fairest"" of them all not because she is a just ruler, but because she is enchantingly beautiful. When the Mirror declares that Snow White is now the fairest, it is not implying that Snow White is a ""just"" princess, but is more fair-skinned, beautiful and radiant than the Queen is.
The Queen takes a potion to turn into the Old Hag, which is irreversible, and she remains this way until her demise on the cliff. She would rather die the Old Hag and sacrifice her beauty (the one thing she truly desires) to trick Snow White, than let Snow White have it.
With this understanding and aim, the remake sharply contrasts the original story as a hollow shell of some set of tropes that no longer bear any meaning. The remake has the Old Hag, Mirror, poisoned apple, and even the dwarves, but none of these things resemble the what they symbolized in the actual story, rendering them pointless and devoid of any consequence.
Here are some examples:
In the remake, Snow White is very independent right from the moment she enters their home. She quickly becomes their ""leader"" and so there really is no point of including the dwarves at all as they contribute nothing to her development. Even at the end when they sneak into the castle for the final fight, they serve literally no purpose.
The Queen transforms into the Old Hag but then can revert to her beautiful old self whenever she pleases. What is the point of the sacrifice if she can just undo it at will? Where is the commentary on human nature where she would rather destroy herself than let the other have all the beauty and glory? The poisoned apple and transformation no longer matter because the Queen can just change anything at any time.
And here is the worst part: at the start of the film, the Mirror declares the Evil Queen is the ""fairest of them all"" and explicitly judges her based on her beauty. She is by no means a just ruler. In fact, when the Queen is first introduced she is set up as ""enchantingly beautiful"" physically.
However, after Snow White frees a rebel, the Mirror declares her to be the fairest, not in a sense of beauty like the original story, but in some socio-political means. This is now a huge shift in the story that is not only reconciled later but gets even more inconsistent.
After Snow White is poisoned and falls asleep, the Mirror once again declares the Queen is the fairest. But which is it? The Mirror claims to judge based on truth, but flip flops between superficial beauty (in the case of the Queen) and deeper justice (in the case of Snow White. Which is it? It cannot be both; the whole point of the story is that a Mirror only judges someone by their appearance. If the Queen is concerned only with beauty, then why does she care if the Mirror is claiming Snow White is the fairest, the most just dep down inside?
The movie ends with the Mirror claiming beauty lies beyond the skin, and yet the Mirror kept switching its definition of ""fairness"" throughout the movie. The definitions are subjective, and it really makes no sense.
Even if we put aside that the story has been blasted apart into a confused jumble of empty tropes (for the sake of nostalgia?) the writing and music is terrible and incredibly forgettable. The sound mixing was off, the voices flat and dull, and most of the dialogue was incredibly forced and boring.
Gal Gadot is simply not a good actress either.

Based on the hype, I was expecting an urban, hip, updated version of the original, which was made back in the Middle Ages, when humans first learned to draw pictures. Instead it's a ""reimagined"" version that lacks any appeal. If the original version has a soul, this version is its lifeless, zombie-Frankenstein evil descendant.
Put it this way, if you take your kid to see this, they'll resent you for the rest of their lives because they wanted to see a beautiful film and you took them to see a bunch of halfwits stumble around the screen looking like mindless zombies.

tt6208148,rw10399100,shashi_dhar71,Original was way better,"When it comes to adapting beloved classics for a modern audience, there's a tightrope to walk-one that balances reverence for the original with the demands of contemporary sensibilities. Unfortunately, the recent remake of Snow white stumbles badly on this tightrope, leaving fans like me longing for the unadulterated brilliance of the original. The plea is simple: the original movie was way better, and it's time to bring back the storyline that made it a timeless gem. Modernizing classics is a tricky endeavor, no doubt, but it has to be done right-or not at all.
The original movie, released decades ago, captured something pure and inimitable. Its storyline was a masterclass in specific genre or theme, e.g., suspense, romance, or adventure, weaving together key elements like character depth, pacing, or atmosphere into a narrative that resonated deeply. The characters felt alive, their motivations grounded in a world that made sense within the story's framework. It wasn't just entertainment; it was an experience-one that lingered long after the credits rolled. That magic, however, is glaringly absent in this latest iteration.
Where the original thrived on authenticity, the remake drowns in a sea of forced modernization. The decision to overhaul the classic storyline feels less like an evolution and more like a betrayal. Gone are the specific plot points or themes, e.g., slow-burn tension or heartfelt simplicity that defined the first film, replaced by a frenetic, trend-chasing mess that prioritizes flash over substance. It's as if the filmmakers decided that today's audiences couldn't handle the elegance of the original pacing or the nuance of its conflicts. Instead, we get specific examples, e.g., unnecessary subplots, CGI-heavy action, or shallow character reboots that clash with the soul of what made the movie special.
Modernizing a classic isn't inherently a bad idea-times change, and so do tastes. But there's a right way to do it, and this isn't it. Take a film like example of a successful remake, where updates enhanced the core story without sacrificing its essence. Those adaptations respected their source material, using new technology or perspectives to amplify what was already great. In contrast, this remake seems to misunderstand why the original worked. It's not enough to slap a fresh coat of paint on a masterpiece and call it progress; you have to honor the foundation while building something new. Here, the foundation feels bulldozed.
The performances, too, pale in comparison. The original cast brought a raw, unpolished energy that grounded the story-think specific actor or scene. The remake's actors, while talented, are saddled with dialogue and motivations that feel focus-grouped to death, stripping away the humanity that once shone through. Even the visuals, though technically impressive, lack the heart of the original's e.g., practical effects or cinematography. It's a textbook case of style over substance, a hollow echo of what came before.
Fans aren't asking for a shot-for-shot rehash-nostalgia alone doesn't sustain a film. But we deserve a return to the storyline that captivated us: one that trusts its audience, leans into its strengths, and doesn't bow to every modern trope. The modernization of classics can work when handled with care, but this remake proves that carelessness leads to disappointment. So here's a plea to the filmmakers: shelve the gimmicks, revisit the original blueprint, and give us back the story we fell in love with. Until then, I'll be rewatching the first movie, where the real magic still lives.",1.0,2025-03-24,50,10,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

tt6208148,rw10410864,a-j-kelly,"Heigh-Ho, Heigh-Ho, Don't Go!","On behalf of me and everyone who agrees with this review, to all of the fallen comrades who had to sit through this nightmare either to write a review or because your kids dragged you to it, we salute you!
""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and its long-lasting impact can't be understated. The classic launched Disney as the animation giant we know today while being the first feature-length animated feature in film history. It's also an immensely charming, simple, yet incredible delight that earned its legacy and then some. It's a shame that Adriana Caselotti, the titular Snow White, was uncredited in this and her other roles. Her name deserves to be associated with the character for her legendary and unforgettable performance. I'd highly recommend seeing it in favor of this occasionally colorful yet predictably dull and extremely tedious extravaganza.
Let me get the positives out of the way so I don't forget to mention them.
First, the CGI was stunning. There were no poor moments of CGI, and the dwarfs weren't as distracting as I thought they'd be.
Next, two songs were catchy and easily the best of the entire film, one original and one from the 1937 version. The ""Heigh-Ho"" sequence is translated wonderfully into live-action, with slightly different lyrics and an enormous mine setting to play with. The only close to the magnificent original song, despite not having the same visual flare and advantage as ""Heigh-Ho,"" is ""Waiting On A Wish."" I thought Rachel Zegler's vocal delivery and the instrumentals go a long way to making the song memorable and very catchy.
Finally, if not ironically, while the writing doesn't do her character any favors, Rachel Zegler delivers a strong performance as Snow White. Zegler never ceases to be powerful, especially in the singing department.
Unfortunately and intensely frustratingly, those three positives can't even come close to saving the increasingly abundant flaws throughout the entire experience.
Primarily, Erin Cressida Wilson's screenplay doesn't give any character that much to do. Snow White is the closest to having any depth, thanks to Zegler, but the rest of the characters are painfully forgettable. Additionally, Wilson's work relies on filler rather than anything meaningful. I'm sure she's talented, but none of her talent is present here.
Said script doesn't make the 1-hour and 49-minute runtime any less woeful. Fine momentum shows itself exclusively within the first forty minutes but then loses itself in the filler. About thirty minutes before its dissatisfying ending, my main desire was to leave. ""Snow White"" is the second film this year where I've had that feeling.
Speaking of which, the ending is plain bad. It strays heavily from the original for the worse, with a stupid final confrontation between Snow White and the Evil Queen. My only spark of misplaced hope once the boredom set in was for the finale to be entertaining, but it wasn't.
Although ""Heigh-Ho"" and ""Waiting On A Wish"" were enjoyable songs, the rest ranged from forgettable to terrible. They only brought ""Heigh-Ho"" and ""Whistle While You Work"" over from the original, the latter being a disappointing re-do. The rest were new compositions, and they're all bland. The two that stand out as particularly awful are ""All Is Fair"" and ""Princess Problems."" I'll return to ""All Is Fair"" in a second, but ""Princess Problems"" was one of the worst songs I've heard in film. No offense to Zegler and Andrew Burnap, but their vocal delivery can't save a piece that nobody will listen to outside of watching this film - if this review hasn't convinced you to skip it yet.
Following this, Gal Gadot was unsurprisingly miscast as the Evil Queen. She's by all accounts a talented actress, so it amazes me how, regardless of the evident fun she's having playing the part, none of that charisma or energy translates to the screen. Furthermore, while she tries, her singing is not up to par with the rest of the game cast, in my opinion. Gadot's underwhelming vocal delivery let down ""All Is Fair"" and its reprise to an unbelievable degree. I hate being this harsh to her performance, and I like her as an actress, but this was not a project that gave her much to work with.
Lastly, where's the Disney magic? I haven't seen it for years. I want it back! None of the new characters were charming, while they removed one of my favorite aspects from the 1937 original: the emphasis on the animal's expressions. The tortoise only gets one close-up shot in the entire thing, while Snow White doesn't interact with any animal outside of the first fifteen minutes. The scene where the animals guide Snow White to the dwarves' home is dialogue-free here, and the seven lack charm past their first meeting with Snow White. These scenes wouldn't been better left unchanged, at the very least. It's a Disney live-action remake; it's what they could've done!
Overall, as much as I don't want to agree with this statement, ""Snow White"" was doomed to fail. My hope that it'd be startlingly decent, even great, was squandered by the film's execution. I thought ""Mufasa: The Lion King"" was far from horrible, but this remake is the best sign that Disney should stop making these live-action remakes. They won't quit because they make money either way. I want ""Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning"" to pull through and make more than ""Lilo & Stitch,"" which opens the same weekend, but the track record indicates the next potential Barbenheimer. Whatever: families will likely pay to see it, while moviegoers and critics like me question why they wasted their time. Now that my opinion is massive dislike, the best reason is to review it.
Technically, the screenplay, the acting, and the music underdeliver. However, the CGI, Marc Webb's okay directing, and Mandy Walker's inconsistent yet sometimes beautiful cinematography make the technical score a 7/10, and I'm a bit too generous with that score.
The enjoyment score is a far cry from the technical score. It may differ depending on who you are, but as a person who often watches films and likes not to be begging for one to end, by default, this is the worst movie I have gone to the theaters for yet. Younger audiences will have the highest chance of getting, at the very least, a 7/10 experience, but I can't say anyone outside of that group will have the same luxury. For me, the enjoyment score is a 3/10. It was astonishingly monotonous, and you should try to avoid it. If you want a song to listen to, catch ""Waiting On A Wish"" on Amazon, Apple, or Spotify. If you're curious, wait until Disney+. If you have no choice, bring coffee or watch ""The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie"" instead. It's the least you can do for yourself.",,2025-03-27,7,8,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0
tt6208148,rw10396309,MaisieDias10,"Despite its many issues, I still thought this was a cute film.","For all the questionable controversies that the Internet created about this film long before it came out, with the only justifiable one being the more than understandable tiredness of the Disney live action remakes, now that I've seen it I say: what a bunch of fuss for nothing. Yes, there's not much here that deserves acclaim and there are clear problems, although none of them involve the controversies of the Internet, but in the end there is absolutely nothing here that deserves hate or controversy. Out of the Disney remakes so far this is nowhere near being one of the worst, in fact I'd say it's actually one of the best, even though it's not a very close competition in this club. It's a weird case because there's a lot to like here, but unfortunately there are many problems in the mix that prevent it from reaching its full potential, with two of them in particular that are quite substantial. The first is Gal Gadot who unfortunately is very bad in the film and just doesn't match with the rest of the cast, even with her beautiful looks. And the second is the extremely hideous design of the dwarves, which really gets in the way of some of the good scenes with them and I could never get used to it. The rest are just adjustments and improvements that I think would have polished the story better, given it more development and room to marinate properly. But fortunately, what saves the experience from all of this is that even if it never reaches perfection, the changes and messages made in this reimagining are still very interesting, and the main star manages to carry the film on her shoulders.
Rachel Zegler is truly wonderful here, you can see that she gave her body and soul to this role and she is the definition of a true Disney princess in the flesh, with the voice of an angel and charisma exploding on screen. She is probably the best Disney Princess of these new live action versions, not only because of the actress's work itself but because I liked everything they did to reimagine Snow White, a character I never loved. Instead of keeping the character archaic like in the original animated feature, or just changing everything about her, they managed to create an arc for her that maintains all the best qualities and essence of the character from the 1937 film, but still updating her for today. She sees herself as a helpless maiden who is incapable of solving things on her own, but through the course of the story she learns that she is more than capable of being brave and strong just as she is. She can help in a fight without knowing how to fight, she can fall in love with someone and still have her own agency, and she can very well achieve what she wants even though she's just someone who wants to be a good person and not step on others to do so, like the Evil Queen does. Not only do I think this is a great idea that keeps the character true to her origins with a modern twist, but it also sends a very smart and sweet message, especially to young girls who so far seem to be the audience that are enjoying the film the most, and for good reason.
Otherwise, I found the production to be mostly very solid and well cared for. The cinematography is full of vibrant colors which is refreshing compared to the many grey filled remakes we got, very detailed sets and surprisingly excellent CGI work. The kingdom itself is the only area that doesn't impress much, it just looks like another medieval kingdom with nothing that stands out, unlike the forests or the dwarves' house for example. The dwarves themselves, despite their terrible design, have some good moments as characters, especially with what they do to Dopey and the musical number ""Whistle While You Work"" which is the best moment of the film. The songs from the original were updated appropriately I would say, so that they could fit in with the new songs and have their own identity without clashing with their classic melodies. As for the new songs, I really liked ""Waiting on a Wish"" and ""A Hand Meets a Hand"", and the musical number along with the melodies of ""All is Fair"" is pretty cool but Gal Gadot's singing unfortunately gets in the way. The rest is serviceable and has some cute moments of choreography or character interaction, but nothing too memorable beyond those I mentioned. And finally, I liked the change made to the prince, who here is a very different character and Andrew Burnap is charming in the role, but the group of bandits that accompanies him have little to do and could have easily been removed from the film.
In the end, despite my fears going into it, I enjoyed this new version of ""Snow White"", even if there is a lot in it that holds it back from being truly special. It's the kind of film that I want to give a higher score for the things I really liked about it, from the good messages to the excellent work of Zegler or the beautiful visuals. But it's undeniable that it is a turbulent experience with a lot of ups and downs. If you can forgive its missteps enough, there's plenty in here that I think is worth checking out, but I can understand those who could not get past them and end up not liking it. But considering the very low expectations I had, the fact that I got some positive and memorable stuff out of it already makes me quite happy, because there are valuable qualities in it that I really appreciated. I can totally see an audience for it that will really enjoy the experience, and despite having many reservations to make, I will certainly be more on the positive side. At least this remake tries to create something fresh without sacrificing everything from the original with some success, and even though it's not free from some of the old issues that all these remakes suffer from, it still manages to have more merits than many of them. I'll happily take more of this then another ""Lion King (2019)"" thank you very much.",6.0,2025-03-23,34,287,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

Joking aside, we all knew from the trailer and word of mouth that this was going to be bad. But even bad movies can be enjoyed if they're just incompetent enough to be unintentionally entertaining.
Unfortunately, Snow White is'nt so-bad-it's-good either, because it lacks ambition. It doesn't aim high and miss, it aims... nowhere.
Snow White is a poster child for the common complaint from cinephiles about how ugly modern digital movies look. It's not hard to see why. Everything is shot in front of a blue screen. When you watch older movies, even failed fantasy efforts like Willow, they still look beautiful. There are shadows, contrasts, scene composition. Snow White, like many modern Disney films, looks dark and muddy. The characters hardly stand out from the background, there are no hard shadows, no bright highlights. Scenes shot in sunlight look darker than my living room.
Why is that?
Well if you compose your scene digitally, you limit yourself if you shoot your actors with hard shadows. So they shoot everything flat. And then add it into a flat scene.
The result being, that everything looks flat, boring and uncinematic.
In addition, the pacing is uneven. Kids will be bored to tears by the slow pace and lack of action and of course the socialist lectures.
People joked about this film being a DEI fest, but it's even worse than imagined. Snow White is no longer a princess, she's a feminist anti-patriarchal social justice warrior pushing for equity - through apple pies.
No, I'm not joking. More than half the movie is her giving social justice lectures about pies which amount to ""those who have more should share"". That's it, that's the message.
Rachel Zegler lacks charisma and charm, but has a decent singing voice.
Gal Gadot absolutely hams it up and is cartoonishly evil in all her scenes. While I never saw her as a great actress, every now and then she delivers a surprisingly good performance, similar to the first Wonder Woman movie. She's hits the perfect tone, and is fun to watch. Maybe it's because she is the only actor who's performance doesn't fall under bland.
Unfortunately, it's not enough to enjoy the movie.
This is by far the worst of the terrible Disney live action remakes.
Bad pacing, forgettable music, awful CGI, disturbing unexpressive dwarve, bad writing, miscast star, ugly photography, cheesy ending with the mirror and about 50 minutes too long.",1.0,2025-03-21,61,14,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

But they shattered one of their most cherished legacies. Snow White is not a reimagining; it is a betrayal.
This is not Snow White. Not even close. They have taken a story that has enchanted generations and ripped its soul apart. The timeless tale of beauty, kindness, and resilience against evil has been twisted into something unrecognizable.
The heart of the legend-the very essence of what made Snow White endure for over a century-is missing. And what remains is an empty shell, a film that wears the name Snow White but has nothing of her spirit.
What made Snow White special? It wasn't just the poisoned apple, the Evil Queen, or the seven dwarfs. It was the fairytale magic. It was the ''pure-hearted girl who won hearts through her kindness'', not arrogance. It was the contrast between innocence and vanity, between good and evil. But this film has no reverence for its own source material.
Instead, it tears apart its own foundation, rewriting history and distorting what made Snow White an icon in the first place.
They didn't adapt Snow White - they erased her. The filmmakers didn't care about preserving the legend. They cared about turning it into something else entirely and slapping the name ''Snow White'' on it. If they wanted to tell a different story, fine-then call it something else! But don't take a beloved classic and distort it beyond recognition.
The Evil Queen is supposed to be ''terrifying''. A chilling embodiment of vanity, envy, and obsession. But here? Stripped of her operatic grandeur, reduced to something utterly forgettable. Where is the ''menace''? Where is the deliciously dark presence that made the original Queen one of Disney's greatest villains?
And the seven dwarfs? Well, if you've seen the discussions, you already know how that went.
This is what stings the most: Snow White is a foundational story. It was the film that made Disney what it is today - the very first animated feature, a cinematic revolution, a legacy passed down through generations. To discard that history so carelessly, to treat it as if it needs fixing when it was never broken to begin with... it's heartbreaking.
Disney has always reinvented fairy tales, but they've never erased their souls before.
This time, they have. They have taken one of their most sacred stories and destroyed its identity.
You want to make a new fantasy film? Great. You want a new heroine, a new world, a new take? Go for it. But don't pretend this is Snow White when it clearly isn't.
Call it ''The Forest Princess''. Call it ''The Magic Mirror''. Call it literally anything else. But don't call it ''Snow White'' - because this isn't her story.
This is not magic.

tt6208148,rw10390342,stevenfallonnyc77,Recipe for disaster,"Another major failure for Disney. How can anyone think this was going to be good? Let's see...
First, let's cast an abrasive Snow White who isn't that attractive, who hates the original 1937 movie and puts it down publicly, who insults over half the population of the USA, is a loudmouth with her political views alienating countless people, and who has marginal talent at best. Not too smart.
Second, let's take out the actual dwarves and put in full-sized people instead. When that doesn't work, let's then CGI the dwarves in, because Hollywood Head Dwarf Peter Dinklage doesn't like any other dwarves in Hollywood getting much-needed jobs but him. After Dinklage's ""outrage"" at Disney possibly actually having dwarf actors in a retitled ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves,"" CGI was used instead, and seven actors won't be getting Disney paychecks. Dinklage goes against his own people, what a guy!
Third, let's ""update"" a timeless story and very successful tale for ""modern"" audiences, at the same time ignoring that the ""modern"" audiences love the 1937 original, unlike the actress playing Snow White.
And quite a few other things.....what could go wrong?
Disney obviously had too much money in this to throw it away, otherwise it really should have gone the way of, say, ""Batgirl"" which supposedly was so bad that Warner Brothers simply refused to release it in theaters or anywhere. But that was ""only"" $90 million, much less than what ""Snow White"" costs, especially including marketing.
If one really has to see this, spare yourself the expense, but out of curiosity maybe glance at it when it eventually streams on Disney if you already have their channel.
But ""Snow White"" exists, and will surely be joke fodder for years to come. It is a devastatingly inept film which frankly was a complete waste of everyone's time.",1.0,2025-03-20,49,10,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

tt6208148,rw10393954,raul-verma,A Poisoned Apple: Why Snow White 2025 Fell Far Short of Enchantment,"The much-anticipated (or perhaps dreaded, depending on your perspective) ""Snow White 2025"" has unfortunately landed with a thud, proving to be a significant misstep for the studio. While numerous factors contribute to its overall failure, the most glaring and ultimately damaging aspect is the casting and subsequent performance of Rachel Zegler in the titular role. Instead of a fresh and captivating take on a beloved classic, we are presented with a Snow White who feels miscast, lacking the essential charm and vulnerability that define the character, ultimately dragging the entire film down with her.
From the outset, Zegler's portrayal struggles to capture the inherent innocence and gentle spirit traditionally associated with Snow White. Her performance often comes across as assertive and even slightly defiant, qualities that clash jarringly with the character's established persona. While some might argue for a ""modern"" take on Snow White, the changes feel less like empowering updates and more like a fundamental misunderstanding of the character's core essence. The audience struggles to connect with a Snow White who doesn't radiate the kindness and inherent goodness that makes her plight so compelling.
Furthermore, Zegler's vocal performance, while undoubtedly technically proficient, lacks the ethereal quality and emotional depth needed for the iconic songs. The musical numbers, instead of soaring and enchanting, often feel strained and disconnected from the emotional narrative. This is a significant blow to a story so deeply rooted in its musical heritage. The magic that should emanate from Snow White's voice is simply absent, leaving the audience feeling underwhelmed and nostalgic for previous iterations.
Beyond the characterization and vocal delivery, Zegler's on-screen presence feels somewhat ill-suited to the fairytale setting. There's a disconnect between her contemporary energy and the fantastical world the film attempts to create. This is not to say that modern actors cannot inhabit period roles, but in this instance, the fit feels forced, preventing the audience from fully immersing themselves in the story.
It's difficult to ignore the sense that the casting was driven by factors other than finding the best fit for the role. While representation is undoubtedly important, prioritizing it over the fundamental qualities of the character has unfortunately resulted in a central performance that actively detracts from the film's potential. This isn't a criticism of Zegler as an individual, but rather a critique of a casting decision that ultimately sabotaged the film.
The weaknesses in Zegler's portrayal ripple outwards, negatively impacting other aspects of the movie. The dynamic between Snow White and the dwarves feels less heartwarming and more transactional, lacking the genuine affection that should be at its core. The Evil Queen's motivations, while perhaps explored with more nuance, lose some of their impact when juxtaposed with a Snow White who doesn't evoke the same level of empathy and protectiveness from the audience. Even the visual spectacle of the film feels somewhat hollow when the central character fails to resonate.
Ultimately, ""Snow White 2025"" falters significantly due to the miscasting and underwhelming performance of Rachel Zegler. While other elements of the film may have their flaws, her portrayal of Snow White lacks the essential charm, vulnerability, and vocal magic needed to bring this beloved fairytale to life. This failure to connect with the audience on a fundamental level makes it difficult to invest in the story, leaving ""Snow White 2025"" as a poisoned apple in the realm of cinematic adaptations, a cautionary tale of prioritizing casting agendas over the intrinsic needs of the character and the story itself. The film's failure will likely be attributed, in no small part, to the central performance that simply couldn't capture the enduring magic of Snow White.",1.0,2025-03-22,44,9,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

For a film often praised as a timeless classic, it feels more like a relic of outdated storytelling, weak character development, and over-simplicity.
The pacing of the film is also an issue. While it's only about 80 minutes long, it drags in parts, particularly with the excessive filler of the dwarfs' antics. Yes, they're cute, but their slapstick humor quickly becomes repetitive. Grumpy is the only one with even a semblance of personality, while the rest are essentially walking gags.

tt6208148,rw10415081,imdbfan-6034631156,Crap,"This so-called adaptation of *Snow White* is an embarrassing misfire on every level. From the wooden performances of the main cast to the baffling deviations from the original story, the film feels like a cheap imitation rather than a genuine reimagining. The lead actress delivers her lines with all the emotion of a cardboard cutout, making it impossible to care about her journey. The supporting cast isn't much better-overacting, awkward delivery, and zero chemistry drag down every scene.
Worse yet, the script butchers the heart of the fairy tale, replacing its timeless charm with dull, modernized tropes that add nothing of value. The pacing is a mess, bouncing between rushed plot points and painfully drawn-out filler. Even the visuals, which should at least offer some spectacle, feel flat and uninspired, with lazy CGI and unimaginative set designs.
Disney's animated classic succeeded because it balanced warmth, humor, and genuine stakes-this film has none of that. Instead, it's a soulless, corporate product with no respect for the source material or the audience's intelligence.

tt6208148,rw10393368,hamza_hk91,A Disastrous Remake That Misses the Magic,"I went into Snow White (2025) with cautious optimism, hoping for a fresh take on a beloved classic. Unfortunately, what we got was a lifeless adaptation that strips away everything that made the original so special. Instead of a heartfelt fairy tale, this film feels like a soulless, agenda-driven project that alienates both longtime fans and new audiences.

Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White lacks the warmth and charm that made the character iconic. Rather than the kind and innocent princess we remember, she comes across as cold and dismissive, making it difficult to root for her. It doesn't help that much of the original story's heart has been removed. The prince is gone, and with him, any real emotional depth. The story attempts to redefine Snow White's journey, but it ends up feeling uninspired and hollow.

One of the biggest missteps is the removal of the Seven Dwarfs. Instead of their unique personalities and camaraderie, we get a group of forgettable characters that add little to the narrative. The magic and charm that the dwarfs brought to the original film are completely absent here.

Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen is one of the few highlights. She delivers a strong performance and brings a theatrical presence to the role. Unfortunately, she isn't given enough screen time to make a real impact. The writing does her no favors either, with dialogue that feels forced and unnatural. Rather than telling a compelling story, the film spends too much time trying to make a statement, often at the expense of good storytelling.

In the end, Snow White (2025) is a film that tries so hard to modernize a classic that it forgets why the original was loved in the first place. The heart, the romance, and the fairy tale magic are all missing, leaving behind a bland and forgettable remake.

Growing up, the 1937 classic never really spoke to me. Snow White felt passive, distant-more a symbol than a character. Aside from the Once Upon a Time TV show version, she had always been my least favorite princess.
But Disney's 2025 Snow White changed everything.
This reimagining gave us the heroine we always needed: fearless, fair, brave, and true. She's no longer just waiting to be rescued-she leads with heart, makes bold choices, and shines with purpose. I saw myself in her strength, her flaws, her hope. It was powerful.
The film is pure magic. The music? Absolutely sing-along worthy-I've had the soundtrack on loop since I left the theater. It captures the spirit of a fairy tale while feeling completely fresh. The tone reminded me of Enchanted, The Princess Bride, Robin Hood: Men In Tights, Tangled, and Ella Enchanted-clever, heartfelt, and fun, with just the right dose of whimsy.

The film does a good job of explaining the relationship between the evil Queen and Snow White. As simply touched in the original film, more time is spent on backstory of what happened to Cinderella's parents and the Queen's ability to put up with Snow White...well, until she doesn't.
A reimagining Seven Dwarfs and Snow White's love interest is refreshing. Oh, they even remembered to incorporate Snow White's loving forrest animals who are by her side, just like in the original. What is a nice bonus is they added some action/adventure in the film while empowering Snow White. No longer is Snow White just the victim or a character that needs saving, Snow White becomes the hero of her own story (with the help of others). This new twist is a good way to empower younger audiences while still letting Snow White choose good to conquer evil.

Snow White is a fair fantasy musical film based on the original animated film. There is some changes but the magic is missing in this one.
Pros:
The plot is good. It's somewhat similar to the original with substituting Prince Charming for Jonathan. Which seemed a bit dull as a character.
Rachel Zegler did great as the role. Her performance and talent is growing and sweet. Gal Gadot as the evil queen was great.
The musical sequences are great. It does hit the high notes with a lot of heart.
Cons
The script felt a little underdeveloped with the characters. Jonathan who is supposed to be Snow Whites love interest was underdeveloped. Making his character dull. The evil queen another underdeveloped character that wastes the talent of Gal Gadot.
The visual effects were a bit of a miss. The dwarves looked like unfinished cgi work. Which was a sad thing. Cause those characters were supposed to be the lovable part of the film. And yet this film makes them forgettable.
Overall, it is an okay film with a great cast but the script is undeveloped in some areas making a lot of characters forgettable. And the visuals were a bit uneven. The musical sequences and casts were great with plenty of entertainment.",6.0,2025-03-24,0,24,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

They're missing the heart, the wonder, the sheer magic that made the originals so special.
'Snow White' should feel like a fairytale, something enchanting and timeless, but instead, this just felt... flat. The visuals were fine, the acting was actually decent, and the reimagining of the dwarfs (or ""magical companions"") wasn't as bad as I'd feared. But it all felt like a box-ticking exercise rather than a film made with love or passion.
Disney keeps trying to modernise these classics, but they seem to have forgotten why people fell in love with them in the first place.

tt6208148,rw10411779,shandilyaind,A Bland Reimagining Despite Gadot's Charismatic Villainy,"Disney's 2025 remake of Snow White arrives with much anticipation but ultimately falls flat, primarily due to a lacklustre performance by its lead. Despite impressive visual effects and elegant production design, the film struggles to engage viewers, overshadowed by its underwhelming portrayal of the iconic princess.
At the heart of the film's failures is the casting and execution of Snow White herself, whose depiction lacks both charisma and warmth. A character renowned for her charm and enchantment, Snow White here becomes a strangely energy-draining presence. Far from captivating, her presence feels awkward and forced, undermining the entire film's tone. Rather than being swept away in a magical retelling, audiences may find themselves struggling to remain seated, experiencing discomfort instead of delight.
In stark contrast, Gal Gadot delivers an outstanding performance as the villain, breathing fresh energy and charm into every scene she commands. Gadot's vibrant portrayal of malevolent charisma creates a stark disparity, highlighting even more clearly the deficiencies in the film's lead performance. Her dynamic screen presence serves as a constant reminder of what the film might have been, had the central casting been more thoughtfully considered.
Unfortunately, Gadot alone cannot salvage the overall experience. As Snow White falters, so too does the audience's patience, culminating in a sense of regret rather than wonder. For those hoping for Disney's magic at its best, Snow White disappoints profoundly, leaving viewers questioning the value of their theater ticket.
In conclusion, Disney's latest remake proves to be a missed opportunity. While Gadot's villain injects vitality, the film is ultimately burdened by its bland, uninspired protagonist. For many viewers, sitting through this adaptation may feel more like an endurance test than entertainment, making Snow White (2025) difficult to recommend.",1.0,2025-03-28,4,0,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

The first story planned for this adaptation was mixed into the first animated film, creating a confusing climax and resolution. Also, the main point of removing the Prince from the 1937 movie was to make it clear that Snow White was independent and did not need a man to save her. Even if a princess falls in love with a powerful man, she is no weaker than a single one. For example, Mulan was the hero of China but still had a love interest that had a role in the army. She is considered the most skilled princess, even if she has a lover. After the backlash against this change, they replaced the Prince with a bandit (sounds like Aladdin, no?). The soundtrack bears little resemblance to the original film rather than creating supposedly new, empowering songs. While the costumes show the magic of Disney, the only one that resembles the original film is Snow White's dress, with the others bearing a slight resemblance to their counterparts.

Her facial expressions when she sings are so bizarre that it's impossible to tell if she's angry, happy, or sad she shifts between emotions every two seconds like she's glitching. Instead of embodying a graceful and kind-hearted princess, she comes across as bossy and frustrating, making it difficult to root for her at all.
Then there are the Seven Dwarfs except, well, they aren't even real. The decision to make them CGI was questionable from the start, but the final result is worse than expected. They look unnatural, lifeless, and completely out of place in the film. The scenes set in their home are particularly painful to watch, especially when Snow White, instead of helping or showing any appreciation, literally orders them to clean the house. What happened to the warmth and friendship in this story?
And, of course, the film follows the now all-too-predictable trend of removing any meaningful romance. While there's nothing wrong with updating themes, the way it's handled here feels forced and empty. Snow White's journey doesn't feel empowering it just feels directionless and, honestly, boring.
Overall, Snow White is a disaster. The visuals are unappealing, the characters lack any heart, and the story strips away everything that made the original special. It's a soulless, frustrating experience that fails both as a remake and as a standalone film. A Hollow and Confusing Reimagining.",1.0,2025-03-27,13,5,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

On the other hand, Snow White herself delivers a commendable performance. Zegler brings warmth and charm to the character, effectively embodying the innocence and kindness that define her. However, despite her strong acting, the script fails to provide her with meaningful dialogue or character development.

tt6208148,rw10390592,imdbfan-3934603421,Soulless mess.,"Disney's Snow White (2025) is a disappointing, unnecessary remake that strips away the charm of the original in favour of a bland, lifeless modernisation. While the film attempts to update the classic tale with a more ""empowered"" Snow White, the result feels forced, uninspired, and ultimately hollow.
Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White is underwhelming. Rather than embodying the warmth and kindness that made the original character so beloved, she comes across as disengaged and unremarkable. Her line delivery lacks depth, making it difficult to connect with her version of the character. Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen had potential, but the film fails to make her truly menacing or memorable. Instead, her performance is reduced to exaggerated expressions and weak writing.
Visually, the movie is a disaster. The CGI is particularly bad, especially when it comes to the seven dwarfs (or the awkward replacements for them). The overuse of digital effects makes everything feel artificial, lacking the organic magic of classic Disney animation or even previous live-action adaptations like Cinderella or Beauty and the Beast. Instead of feeling enchanted, I was distracted by how oddly animated and unrealistic everything looked.
The narrative itself is muddled. Disney clearly wanted to move away from the traditional fairy-tale romance, but in doing so, they created a story that lacks emotional depth. The attempts at modern empowerment feel like a checklist rather than meaningful character development. Snow White no longer dreams of love, but she also doesn't seem to have a compelling alternative goal. It's as if the film is more focused on rejecting the past than telling a strong new story.
Even the music fails to leave an impression. The new songs are forgettable, and the absence of iconic classics like Someday My Prince Will Come only makes the film feel more disconnected from its roots.
Overall, Snow White is a soulless cash grab, proving once again that not every classic needs a remake. Instead of adding something new, it takes away everything that made the original special.",1.0,2025-03-20,39,8,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

My personal favorite part? When Snow White girlbossed the dwarfs into doing chores for her. In the original, she lovingly said, ""And I will use the broom."" But in this one? Nope. It's ""And HE will use the broom."" Nothing says empowerment like delegating housework to a group of hardworking men who were minding their own business. Truly inspiring.
But wait-why stop at ruining the dwarfs when you can also add seven completely pointless bandits? That's right, we got dwarfs AND bandits, and yet somehow, the film had double the characters and half the charm. These bandits were about as necessary as a glass slipper at a marathon. Seriously, why were they there? What was their purpose? Did they get lost on their way to a Robin Hood audition?
I physically walked out of this movie. Not metaphorically, not emotionally-I stood up and left. And honestly? I think even the Prince wanted out.
Rachel Zegler: ""I don't need a Prince to save me.""
The Prince: ""Good, because I'm actually here for your stepmother.""

tt6208148,rw10394012,jodysam-84910,I need to bleach my eyes.,"Rachel Zegler is obnoxious and gal gadot is a genocidal psychopath.
Where do I even begin with Snow White (2025)? This film is a perfect storm of everything wrong with modern Hollywood: tone-deaf casting, insufferable performances, and a story so mangled it makes the original fairy tale seem like Shakespeare.
Let's start with Rachel Zegler as Snow White. Her portrayal is nothing short of obnoxious. Instead of the graceful, kind-hearted princess we all know, Zegler delivers a smug, self-righteous performance that makes you root for the Evil Queen. Her line delivery is grating, and her attempts at humor fall flatter than a pancake. It's clear she's trying way too hard to be ""relatable"" and ""modern,"" but it just comes off as cringe-worthy.
And then there's Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen. If Zegler is obnoxious, Gadot is downright unwatchable. Her performance is so wooden and lifeless, it's like she's reading her lines off a cue card for the first time. The character is supposed to be menacing and cunning, but Gadot's portrayal is more like a bored Instagram influencer trying to act evil. It's laughable, but not in a good way.
The script is a disaster. Instead of embracing the timeless charm of the original story, the writers decided to inject it with a heavy-handed political agenda that feels forced and unnecessary. The dialogue is clunky, the pacing is all over the place, and the attempts at ""modernizing"" the story are so ham-fisted, they'll leave you rolling your eyes.
The visuals are equally disappointing. The CGI is so overdone it looks like a video game cutscene from 2010. The dwarfs, who are now inexplicably replaced by a group of ""magical creatures,"" are forgettable and uninspired. The film tries to be visually stunning, but it ends up looking like a cheap knockoff of *Into the Woods*.
In short, *Snow White (2025)* is a dumpster fire of a movie. It's a perfect example of how not to adapt a classic fairy tale. Rachel Zegler's obnoxious performance and Gal Gadot's lifeless acting are just the tip of the iceberg. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.",1.0,2025-03-22,48,10,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

Rachel Zegler delivers a commendable performance as Snow White, but her efforts are undermined by a convoluted script and lackluster direction. Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen lacks the menace and depth needed for such an iconic villain, resulting in a flat and unconvincing performance. The CGI-rendered dwarfs are unsettling and fall deep into the uncanny valley, making them more distracting than endearing. The film's over-reliance on computer-generated imagery extends to its environments, which feel artificial and lifeless, stripping away any sense of wonder.

tt6208148,rw10392792,bridgetterecinos,Not Quite The Fairest,"As a die hard Snow White fan, when I heard they were making a remake of the original Disney princess and the first-ever full length animated film, my thoughts were ""Good luck with that! Those are very big shoes to fill!""

I came into the theater not expecting much, because even if they were to remake Snow White exactly the same as the 1937 film, it still wouldn't do it justice. There's a reason why Walt Disney didn't want anyone messing with Snow White -- that movie was his baby. He even asked the original voice actress Adriana Caselotti to never audition for any other acting role to keep the image of Snow White in tact. There's also a reason why it's considered to be the movie staple of pioneering animation. With all that being said...

Snow White (2025) is fine as a 2025 movie, but it does nothing for the original film. The movie felt like they were borrowing the iconic costumes from the 1937 film, but I wasn't actually seeing a remake of that film. The musical numbers are absolutely beautiful and truthfully Rachael Zegler did a phenomenal job with the singing. Despite her horrid reputation, I think she pulled off the kind, graceful, and sweet princess Snow White is with a bit more complexity. I like to give credit where credit is due. However, she didn't have the same mannerisms as the original Snow White in 1937 so I saw Rachael as another version of Snow White, but not THE Snow White from the original animation.

Surprisingly, Rachael outshone Gal Gadot in every department. You may not like Rachael, but she carried that movie on her back. Gal Gadot had beautiful gowns... and that's it. Her acting was really bad and her villainous interpretation wasn't intimidating to me. The evil queen in the original is an extremely vile character, so I was expecting her to bring intensity and darkness, but it was just fell flat. She also can't sing which made her role even more laughable during her musical number. The dwarves were a bit weird, it took some time to get used to - and truthfully, I wish they would've used real actors to bring more heart into the movie. There were literally three physical human dwarves in the film, yet they weren't casted as the dwarves?

Plot wise, the movie was all over the place. There was no real plot, and they included the 7 magical bandits which had absolutely no reason to be in the film. The ending was anti-climactic and weird. The film was jumbled up together, and it felt like 2-3 movies put into one. I felt like this movie didn't come across as confident, but rather people-pleasing and weak. They were trying to coddle everyone's feelings with the woke ideologies and it ended up hurting the project more than anything. If they would've stuck to the original Snow White plot, it would've been a great film with so much nostalgia and heart.

I think this movie was mid, and it was entertaining, but it wasn't spectacular like the original Snow White in 1937. In some parts of the film, I felt they were teasing us with elements of the original film, but it felt short an unintentional. For example, the silly song was only 1 minute long, and there was no ""Buddle Uddle Um Dum"", ""Someday My Prince Will Come"", and ""One Song"" . The more modern songs got more serious screen-time, and that saddened me. They could've made the ""silly song"" and the ""buddle cuddle um dum"" cute and charming with amazing choreography with real dwarves. I say this because the only times I was genuinely smiling in the film was during the ""heigh ho"" and ""Whistle While You Work"" numbers. This modern take of Snow White took out all the fun from the original, and made it into a political message, and it felt heavy in the movie. In some scenes, it felt like I was seeing a woman dressed as Snow White in a different movie. There was no integrity to the source material, and that's why this movie falls flat for me.

Overall the movie is okay. I don't think anyone should go run to see Snow White, unless they are a die hard Snow White fan and need to see the film and catch some new merchandise. You can wait until it comes out in Disney plus and it wouldn't make a difference. I really enjoyed Rachael's performance and glad I gave her a chance because her voice and acting carried the film. Everything else was forgettable slop, and by no means does it have the same essence, charm, and originality as the original 1937 film. Absolutely no comparison, and Walt Disney is definitely rolling on his grave with this one.",3.0,2025-03-21,231,81,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

What was once a timeless fairy tale full of heart and wonder has been reduced to a soulless, confused mess that seems more interested in making a statement than telling a coherent story.
The lead performance lacks charm or depth, and the character of Snow White has been stripped of everything that made her compelling. Instead of feeling like a modern heroine, she comes off as detached, arrogant, and unrelatable. The supporting characters are equally uninspired, and the reimagined dwarves - or rather, ""magical forest people"" - feel shoehorned in and poorly written.
Visually, the film is dull and inconsistent, with CGI that borders on embarrassing in several scenes. Even the iconic elements - the apple, the mirror, the evil queen - are handled with such laziness or awkward reinterpretation that they lose all impact.
Worse still is the script, which feels like a disjointed collection of forced dialogue and misguided attempts at humor. There's no magic, no heart, and certainly no reason to revisit this version when so many better adaptations exist.

tt6208148,rw10391088,roddydelagarza-30651,A Technical Womder & a Delightful Experience,"Disney's 2025 live-action adaptation of ""Snow White,"" directed by Marc Webb, offers a fresh take on the classic tale, blending nostalgia with contemporary storytelling. Rachel Zegler shines in the titular role, embodying Snow White's innocence and strength with a captivating performance that breathes new life into the character. Opposite her, Gal Gadot delivers a compelling portrayal of the Evil Queen, exuding a chilling elegance that adds depth to the iconic villain.
The film introduces Andrew Burnap as Jonathan, a new character who serves as Snow White's ally and love interest. Burnap's chemistry with Zegler brings warmth and authenticity to their evolving relationship, providing a modern twist to the traditional narrative. The Seven Dwarfs are reimagined with a blend of voice acting and motion capture, featuring talents like Jeremy Swift (Doc), Tituss Burgess (Bashful), and Andrew Barth Feldman (Dopey), among others. This approach offers a unique visual representation, though it has sparked discussions regarding the use of CGI over practical casting.
Musically, the film balances classic melodies such as ""Whistle While You Work"" with new compositions by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. Notably, the duet ""Princess Problems"" between Snow White and Jonathan stands out, reflecting their differing worldviews and adding depth to their characters. Visually, the movie enchants with lush landscapes and intricate set designs that immerse the audience in a fantastical realm.
However, the film is not without its critiques. Some viewers feel that the reliance on CGI for the dwarfs diminishes their charm, and certain modern updates may not resonate with all fans of the original. Despite these points, ""Snow White"" succeeds in delivering a heartfelt and visually stunning experience, honoring the legacy of the original while introducing thoughtful updates for a new generation.
In summary, ""Snow White"" (2025) stands as a testament to Disney's ability to reimagine its classics, offering a film that is both familiar and refreshingly new. With standout performances from Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot, it invites audiences to revisit a beloved story through a contemporary lens.",8.0,2025-03-21,97,860,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

She perfectly embodies the Snow White persona. Innocent, charming, strong. The movie talks about how she was born during a snow storm and that is why she is named Snow White. She still has the short black hair and the yellow, blue and red dress so everyone can chill out.
They changed a few of the songs, which is a little bit of a disappointment, but I guess the old songs are a little dated with a girl waiting for her prince to come and save her. The movie flips that narrative and Snow White actually has to save the guy, who isn't even a prince, but a rebel against the queen.
Gal Gadot is fabulous in her Snow Queen dress and jewels. She does give off evil, which I love since she so often plays the heroine. Mirror needs to have his eyes checked bc the queen is definitely the fairest in the land with those stunning looks. But I think the mirror is looking at inner beauty too.

Snow White 2025 is not a good movie. It tries to change the classic story, but it fails. The movie is boring, the characters are strange, and the special effects are not great.

First, the story is a mess. Snow White is not the same sweet girl from the original. She is too serious and has no personality. The Queen is still evil, but her reasons make no sense. The dwarfs are gone, and instead, we have random people who do not add much to the story. The movie wants to be modern, but it just ruins the magic.

The Prince is also useless. In the original, he saves Snow White, but here, he does nothing important. The movie tries to be different, but it forgets what made the original story special.

The special effects are not great. Some scenes look fake, and the magic does not feel real. The costumes are okay, but Snow White's dress does not look like Snow White. It feels like a different movie.

The acting is not good either. The actors try too hard, and the dialogue sounds weird. The Queen is the only good part, but even she cannot save this movie.

Worse, the odd misplaced characters with Jonathan. Aside from the bow guy, we have no idea who they are, or worse, why they are even there. They do nothing to the story, why have them?

tt6208148,rw10404195,RellikS-,A Disastrous Reimagining,"Disney's latest take on Snow White is, quite simply, a baffling mess. From the moment the film begins, it's clear that creativity, effort, and even basic storytelling have taken a backseat. If you're looking for stunning visuals or a compelling narrative, look elsewhere-because what you'll find here is a film that feels uninspired, rushed, and painfully cringeworthy.
The graphics? Subpar. The writing? Lazy. The charm and magic Disney was once known for? Nowhere to be found. Instead, Snow White serves up a bland, lifeless experience that drains any excitement you might have had going in. If you're hoping for a modernized twist on a classic, prepare for disappointment. If you're simply looking to kill time, be warned-you may end up feeling even more bored than when you started.

tt6208148,rw10393265,jamesjaegerjaquez,"An unnecessary, soulless remake","I just had the misfortune of witnessing the butchered remains of a beloved Disney classic, Snow White. The 2025 iteration, starring Rachael Zegler as the titular character, is an unmitigated disaster.
The film's troubled production history is well-documented, with numerous reshoots and last-minute changes that have resulted in a disjointed, tone-deaf mess. The CGI dwarfs, meant to be a technological marvel, come across as creepy and unconvincing. Real little people should have been cast for these roles. How far have you fallen, Disney? It's a shame, really, as the original's charm and character were deeply rooted in the memorable performances of the Seven Dwarfs.
But the real travesty here is Rachael Zegler's involvement. Her vocal disdain for the original story and its supposed ""problematic"" themes is not only misguided but also reeks of opportunism. It's clear that she's more interested in pushing her own agenda than in genuinely bringing this character to life. Her acting, as always, was extremely subpar and flat. Her only talent is that she's an above average singer.
The sole bright spot in this catastrophe is Gal Gadot, who brings a sense of gravitas and depth to her role as the Evil Queen. Her performance is a masterclass in nuance and subtlety, elevating the entire production with her presence. It's a shame that her talents are wasted in this otherwise forgettable film.
Snow White (2025) is a mess, a soulless reimagining that fails to capture the magic and wonder of the original. Even the most ardent Disney fans will find themselves checking their watches, waiting for the agony to end. Avoid this monstrosity at all costs.

This movie in no way holds up any of the standards Disney has committed to in the past.
This does not even begin to resemble a true Disney film from this era or the past. If it is the future of Disney then the entire studio is dead.
Storyline, acting, editing and even the lighting was inconsistent and distracting.
For the amount of time it took to get the picture made and edited, one would think there would have been plenty of time to focus group this production and make changes to make it somewhat entertaining.
Sitting through the entire production felt as if the producers were trying to make us like their new vision of filmmaking.

The best part of Snow White was Rachel Zegler as Snow White her acting and vocal performance were perfect and she played Snow White excellent for this adaptation of Snow White. But compared to the original Snow White, she was miscast.

Another standout was Andrew Burnap as Jonathan who replaced prince character from the original Snow White movie he was very charming his character remember me of Flynn Rider from Disney tangled movie.

The worst part of movie was gal gadot as evil queen because acting was so bad and laughable at times especially a big musical moment was so bad. She was miscast an actress like Anne Hathaway or Demi Moore would have been better to play evil queen.

In a modern script, you'd hope for more nuance and wit, but this line suggests that little thought was put into avoiding old-fashioned gender-based humor. Whether intentional or not, it highlights the ongoing issue of writers relying on outdated tropes instead of pushing storytelling forward. There's nothing wrong with playing with classic fairy tale dynamics, but it should be done with purpose and creativity, not as an easy punchline at the expense of progress.

This film is less a magical journey and more a painful exercise in how to completely butcher a beloved story.
The screenplay reads like it was written by a committee of disinterested marketing executives who once heard someone describe Snow White in passing. Our titular character, played with all the charisma of a department store mannequin, stumbles through a plot so convoluted that even the seven dwarfs would struggle to make sense of it.
The visual effects are a catastrophe that would make even low-budget YouTube creators cringe. The enchanted forest looks like it was constructed using a combination of stock footage and a toddler's finger paintings. The evil queen's transformation scenes are so poorly executed that they appear to have been rendered on a smartphone from 2010.
Dialogue reaches new heights of cringe-worthiness, with lines so wooden they could be used as lumber in home construction. Characters deliver exposition with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination. Every potentially interesting moment is crushed under the weight of unnecessary plot twists and painfully forced attempts at ""modernizing"" the classic tale.
The musical numbers - if one can even call them that - sound like they were composed during a particularly uninspired karaoke night. Auto-tune is weaponized to such an extent that it becomes a form of auditory assault.
Perhaps the most offensive aspect of this film is how it manages to strip away every ounce of magic from a story that has enchanted generations. This isn't a reimagining; it's a total dismemberment of a classic fairy tale.

tt6208148,rw10405273,abdullahkhanniazi-94434,Snow White - the worst movie ever,"I can't explain how disappointing this movie was. Simply disappointing. What the hell was that?
From the moment the first teaser dropped, Snow White (2025) sparked controversy, and unfortunately, the final product only amplified concerns. The decision to modernize the narrative by removing the prince and altering the portrayal of the seven dwarfs was seen as a significant departure from the original. Many fans who grew up with Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) were left confused and frustrated. This wasn't just a simple retelling-it was a complete overhaul of a beloved classic, one that left little resemblance to the timeless fairy tale.
Characterization & Performances
Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen? Not for me. Sure, she looked the part-elegant, regal, and strikingly beautiful-but her performance lacked the gravitas needed to make the Queen truly menacing. Instead of exuding the chilling menace of the animated version, Gadot's Evil Queen often felt like a watered-down villain, more style than substance. Her character's motivations felt hollow, and despite her attempts to bring a sense of theatricality, it all fell flat.
Then there's Snow White herself. Snow White (played by Rachel Zegler) is no longer the passive princess waiting for true love's kiss. Instead, she is reimagined as an independent, strong-willed leader who dreams of ruling her kingdom without needing a prince. While the idea of a self-sufficient heroine is admirable, the execution left much to be desired. Instead of a charming and kind-hearted princess, this version of Snow White comes off as detached and, at times, unlikable. Zegler's performance is serviceable, but it lacks the warmth and sincerity that made the original character so endearing.
The Evil Queen (Gal Gadot) remains obsessed with Snow White's beauty, but the central conflict is now more about power than romance. While modernizing a fairy tale isn't inherently a bad thing, the way it was handled here stripped the story of its emotional core. The original Snow White wasn't just about romance-it was about kindness, innocence, and resilience. This version of the story, however, feels like a forced attempt to be ""progressive"" at the expense of its heart.
One of the most controversial changes is the complete removal of Prince Charming. While Disney has been moving away from the ""damsel in distress"" trope in recent years, the decision to remove the prince altogether left many fans wondering why the film was even called Snow White. The prince's role in the original was small, but his presence was symbolic. Here, the omission feels less like an organic change and more like an attempt to distance itself from traditional fairy tale elements entirely.
Additionally, the seven dwarfs are no longer the beloved, unique characters from the original but are instead replaced by a group of diverse magical creatures. This change, meant to be more ""inclusive,"" ended up alienating audiences even further. Fans cherished the dwarfs not just because they were short but because they each had distinct personalities that added charm and humor to the story. Replacing them with generic magical creatures resulted in a loss of character depth and emotional connection.
Visuals & Direction
Visually, Snow White has some beautiful moments. The cinematography is colorful and grand, and the costume design is impressive. However, the CGI used for the magical creatures and backgrounds feels inconsistent, making some scenes look artificial rather than immersive. There are moments of visual spectacle, but they are overshadowed by jarring CGI work that pulls you out of the experience rather than drawing you in.
The film's pacing also suffers, with certain moments dragging while others feel rushed. Scenes that should have been impactful lack weight, and the story's flow feels choppy. Director Marc Webb (The Amazing Spider-Man) tries to inject a modern sensibility into the film, but the result feels disjointed. Instead of a timeless fairy tale, Snow White often feels like a generic fantasy film with a familiar name slapped onto it for brand recognition.
Final Verdict
Snow White had the potential to be a fresh and exciting update to a beloved classic. Instead, it comes off as a misguided attempt to modernize a story that didn't need drastic changes. With weak character development, controversial creative choices, and a script that feels more like a checklist of modern themes than a cohesive narrative, Snow White ultimately fails to capture the magic of the original.
At its core, Disney's Snow White feels like a film that doesn't know who it's for. It alienates fans of the original, disappoints those who wanted an exciting retelling, and frustrates audiences who wanted something more than a hollow attempt at ""progressive"" storytelling. If you were looking forward to a nostalgic, heartwarming experience, you won't find it here.
Rating: 1/10

Disney's Snow White promised to bring a fresh take on the beloved classic, but unfortunately, it falls flat-especially due to Gal Gadot's uninspired performance as the Evil Queen.
Gadot's portrayal lacks the depth, menace, and charisma needed to bring this iconic villain to life. Instead of exuding the chilling, regal presence of the original Evil Queen, she delivers stiff line readings and an almost cartoonish overperformance. Her attempt at villainy feels forced rather than natural, making it hard to take her seriously as a threat. It's as if she's simply reciting lines rather than truly embodying the role.
The rest of the film doesn't fare much better. The modernized changes to the story feel unnecessary and fail to capture the magic that made Snow White a timeless tale. The visuals are impressive, but all the CGI in the world can't make up for weak storytelling and lackluster acting.
Ultimately, Snow White is a missed opportunity. With stronger casting choices-especially for the villain-it might have had a chance. But as it stands, it's yet another disappointing live-action remake that proves not every classic needs to be retold.",1.0,2025-03-28,10,4,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0
tt6208148,rw10425521,zeroartgfx,Disappointing :(,"Disney's latest Snow White remake is yet another example of a classic film losing its charm in the transition to live action. It's visually underwhelming and lacks the heart that made the original so special.
Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White falls flat. Her performance feels stiff and unconvincing, making it hard to connect with the character. While her singing is great, the new songs are forgettable and fail to bring any magic to the film.
The special effects were a major letdown. Instead of creating an immersive fairytale world, the effects felt cheap and artificial. The reimagined dwarves are particularly awkward, making the film feel more like a rushed streaming release than a high-budget Disney production. Disney is always about the MAGIC and I wasn't feeling it here.
Beyond the technical flaws, the story itself feels uninspired. It tries to modernize the tale but loses the innocence and warmth that made the original so beloved. The end result is a dull, disjointed film that doesn't justify its existence. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for remakes, but they need to be given the care and respect they deserve, and I don't feel like Disney did that here.
Unless you're just curious, it's best to skip this one and stick to the original. Hopefully in a decade or two they come out with a new one that actually works.",3.0,2025-04-01,10,4,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

Gal added more personality to the queen than the animation. But ofc she's gonna get bashed because that's the trendy thing to do about her now, likely RZ as well.

The thief swap instead of prince I didn't enjoy as he & snow white's dynamic just felt very rapunzel & Flynn Ryder. It was meh but not loyal to the plot & took out ""someday my prince will come."" The dynamic was the really only odd standout point.

The music was good as the originals mixed in with Pasek & Paul's writing for the new ones. The overall story did seem very quick & small, however they can happen translating animation from decades ago. The dwarves were well casted & humorous. Gal's hag was less scary than the animated honestly. The CGI looked good in place of the controversy on hiring real actors for films.

The overall vibe was that Snow White could be a hero herself, which in no world is a bad thing despite opinions lol...just not story accurate.

No matter what, Disney is going to be scrutinized for the LA remakes for being too similar or too different so there's no winning. I grew up watching all the classics & enjoy the nostalgia of seeing the remakes.

If you don't go into films expecting to judge & critique them all at Oscar's level performance & just watch for fun you'll be fine. It's a simple family film.

Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White is described as unconvincing, with her portrayal lacking depth and charm. While her singing ability is acknowledged, her character comes across as overly passive and inconsistent. The Evil Queen, played by Gal Gadot, is noted for her striking presence but is undermined by a script that fails to explore her motivations effectively.
Key plot points, such as Snow White's quest to find her father and the dynamics with the Seven Dwarfs, are riddled with inconsistencies and underdeveloped arcs. The narration by Dopey feels unnecessary and detracts from the story. Additionally, the film's tone awkwardly shifts between dark and whimsical, leaving viewers unsure of its intended audience.
Visually, the movie struggles to create an immersive fantasy world, and its small-scale production design detracts from the grandeur expected in a Disney remake.

Originality 0. Nothing new here it's a remake and a bad one at that.
Story 1. A story that doesn't really know where it's going at time. I wish I knew where the writing was at in their thoughts? It seems like they were trying more or less to write with a point in mind then to recapture the magic of the original Grimm or Disney tale.

Acting. 3 Gal Gadot is wearing the crown for a reason. Her performance is only thing that keeps this moving on point. She is a pretty and wicked queen. Rachel Zegler has her moments but they are few and far between. Most of the movie she seems to be forced in the plot because she is snow white. Very out of place. Ansu Kabia as the huntsman is not to scary and sometimes he's present in the movie with no presence. The dwarves are CGI so nothing good can come from that performance.

Disney's attempt to modernize this beloved fairy tale resulted in a film that feels neither nostalgic nor innovative-it simply feels empty.
A Lead Character That Lacks Charm
One of the biggest issues with this adaptation is Snow White herself. The character in the original story was known for her kindness, innocence, and warmth-qualities that made her beloved by the dwarfs and the audience alike. In this version, however, she is rewritten into a completely different person, and not in a good way. Instead of a kind-hearted and gentle protagonist, we get a self-righteous, almost arrogant version of Snow White who lacks any real charm. There is no sense of wonder or joy in her journey, and she doesn't feel like a character you want to root for.
The performance also leaves much to be desired. There is no depth, no warmth, and no real emotional range. Every line delivery feels forced and unnatural, making it hard to connect with her character. It's a shame because a strong lead performance could have salvaged some of the film's weaker moments.
Where is the Magic?
Disney built its empire on telling magical, timeless stories, but this film has none of that. The whimsical atmosphere that made the original so enchanting is completely absent. The visuals are bland, the cinematography is uninspired, and even the fantasy elements feel generic. Instead of the rich, colorful world we expect from a Snow White adaptation, we get a film that looks strangely dull and lifeless.
The lack of effort in the CGI is another huge letdown. The creatures and backgrounds often look artificial and unfinished, making it hard to feel immersed in the world. When you compare this to Disney's past live-action films, the drop in quality is shocking. It's as if the studio didn't even try to create something visually memorable.
The Dwarfs Are an Afterthought
One of the most beloved aspects of the original Snow White is the seven dwarfs, each with their own distinct personality and charm. In this version, however, they are almost irrelevant. Instead of being integral to the story, they feel like last-minute additions that serve no real purpose. Their interactions with Snow White lack warmth and humor, and there is no real emotional bond between them.
This is one of the biggest disappointments of the film because the dwarfs added so much heart and comedy to the original. Without them, the movie feels even more lifeless.
The Villain is Forgettable
A great Disney movie needs a great villain, but the Evil Queen in this version is nothing special. In the animated classic, she was terrifying, elegant, and truly menacing. Here, she is just... there. She lacks any real presence or threat, and her motivations are vague at best.

At the center of the mess is Rachel Zegler, whose portrayal of Snow White is shockingly lifeless and condescending. Rather than honoring the role with grace and wonder, she seems more interested in mocking the original character than embodying her. Her performance is cold, smug, and drenched in modern cynicism. It's hard to tell if she even wanted to be in this film, and frankly, it shows.
Gone is the charm, the innocence, the magic. Zegler's Snow White is stripped of all the qualities that made the character iconic, replaced with a preachy, joyless figure who feels utterly out of place in a fairy tale. It's less a performance and more of a statement-and a poorly delivered one at that.
The only redeeming aspect of this disaster is Gal Gadot, who actually seems to understand the assignment. As the Evil Queen, she brings elegance, charisma, and a theatrical flair that's both entertaining and visually captivating.

The role of Snow White has always carried a certain image: soft-spoken, kind-hearted, and with a kind of timeless beauty that fits the fairy-tale world. Unfortunately, the actress in this adaptation doesn't quite capture any of that.

Things I loved: -geniunely created a love story,even though he is no prince,Jonathan was funny and their banter and relationship was beautiful

-the songs (except gal gadot's) were amazing!

-I liked the fact that they kept her sweet and kind but they also made her brave and fearless and that she went to save her father's kingdom,they modernized that and I loved it (even tho I thought I wouldn't)

Things I didn't

-her hair and outfit could've been better. As in her hair was way too short and the dress could've been the same as the original,with a dress of blue and pale yellow and short sleeves -Gal Gadot's acting and singing -CGI could've been much better,even tho that isn't my biggest complain.",10.0,2025-03-30,4,31,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

tt6208148,rw10413380,gepetordi,Horrible! Disappointed! Uninspired!,"""Snow White (2025) is, without a doubt, one of the biggest cinematic disappointments I've ever seen. As a fan of the original fairy tale and Disney's 1937 animated classic, I hoped this live-action reimagining would bring something fresh and captivating. Instead, I got a messy hodgepodge of bad decisions, subpar visual effects, and a total lack of respect for the story that charmed generations.
Rachel Zegler, in the titular role, feels completely detached from Snow White's essence. Her performance is stiff, lacking the warmth and innocence that defined the character. The attempt to turn the princess into a modern, independent figure sounds good on paper, but on screen, it comes off as forced and uninspired. Gal Gadot, as the Evil Queen, should have been a highlight, but her delivery is theatrical in the worst way-more cartoonish than menacing.
The CGI effects are another disaster. The seven dwarfs, now digitally animated creatures, look like they were pulled from a cheap video game, not a $270 million Disney production. Their scenes are cringe-worthy, and the absence of real actors in these roles feels like an insult to the spirit of the original story. The script is a chaotic mess, filled with pointless moments and dialogue that makes you wonder who greenlit this.
It all feels like a cash grab riding on nostalgia, offering nothing of value in return. It's a mockery of Disney's legacy and a complete waste of time. 1/10-and that's only because I can't give it less.""",1.0,2025-03-28,7,2,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

Even with these controversies aside it is hard not to ignore the current political divide for those aware of the emotional turmoil besetting the United States and the plotline of the movie as dramatically displayed on screen. Nevertheless in sending these non-cinematic concerns to the backseat, this movie has its rich musical, lyrical charm, strong singing numbers, and a harder dramatic edge that even appears to have some young children captivated. There is plenty of wry humor, timely musical numbers, and good pacing except for a moment in the middle of the movie and one musical number that could easily have been edited out. The underlying message of cooperation, fairness, and kindness, and, yes, getting along with others from all walks of life form a backbone of this movie in the form of Rachel Zegler as the titular Snow White. Gal Gadot also offers up a strong evil character with her own snazzy musical piece and performance as the wicked stepmother and sometimes creepy, appealing hag.

One of the biggest issues is that the film excludes real dwarfs, replacing them with average-sized actors.

Snow White is a story of the victory of good vs Evil, of love and virtue... not ego 'winning' evil, breaking of family for the power of self (which is no power at all but a severe social disability).
I truly hope it is a major flop but I guess there are enough people curious and enough indoctrination of the youth through marketing to make it profitable.despite the drivel it is.
It is such a disaster in not reading the room that they had to redo the dwarfs because they in their infinite madness thought it was rude to cast dwarfs in a movie called Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (not Snow White and the Seven Samurai which is another story completely written by Tom Holt and not Grimm).

Rachel Zegler, who portrays Snow White, spends the entire movie looking like she's genuinely surprised she landed the role-and not in a good way. Her performance feels disconnected, as if she's impersonating Snow White rather than truly embodying her.

This latest attempt at bringing a beloved classic to life fails spectacularly, plagued by missteps in nearly every department-most notably, the performances and the completely mismatched casting. What could have been an opportunity for a fresh take on the iconic fairy tale is instead a dull, lifeless reimagining that feels more like a rushed, low-budget knockoff than a major Disney production.
As the Evil Queen, Gal Gadot fails to instill the character with the necessary menace and complexity. Despite her stunning looks, Gadot's portrayal of the narcissistic villain lacks the depth and fear-inducing presence that made the Queen such an iconic antagonist in the original. Instead of a terrifying obsession with beauty and power, we get more of a disinterested Instagram influencer who can't seem to decide if she's plotting world domination or deciding on her next outfit. The character's supposed obsession with being ""the fairest of them all"" is laughable, especially when we're told that Snow White, by comparison, is supposedly the ""fairest."" Gadot's Evil Queen might look the part, but her performance doesn't even come close to capturing the cold-hearted malice that made the character unforgettable.
Ultimately, Snow White (2025) is yet another example of a Disney remake that misses the mark entirely. With miscast performances, distracting CGI, and a lackluster script, it fails to capture the charm and wonder of the original. It tries to modernize the story but ends up stripping it of everything that made it special in the first place. Instead of creating a fresh take on a beloved classic, the film delivers a soulless and forgettable experience. If you're looking for the magic of Snow White, stick with the 1937 classic-or better yet, don't bother with this version at all. It's a fairy tale gone horribly wrong.",1.0,2025-03-30,3,0,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

Disney's latest attempt at a Snow White adaptation proves that not all fairy tales deserve a live-action makeover-at least not like this. Instead of a whimsical, timeless story, we get a hollow, soulless reimagining that strips away everything magical in favor of a forced, uninspired narrative. Snow White herself feels less like beloved princess and more like a generic protagonist thrown into a story that barely resembles the original. The film tries so hard to be ""modern"" that it forgets the importance of genuine character development. The supporting cast is forgettable, the humor falls flat, and the CGI? Overused to the point where you wonder if anything real was actually filmed. The worst part? The heart and wonder of the original are completely missing. It's as if the filmmakers were more concerned with making a statement than telling a compelling story. The Evil Queen, usually the highlight of any Snow White adaptation, feels underutilized, and the so-called romance is nonexistent. Disney has done better. They can do better. But this?

So when I sat down to watch this film, I was genuinely excited and hopeful. Unfortunately, that excitement quickly turned into disappointment, and by the end, I was left in complete disbelief.
This was, without a doubt, the worst Disney film I have ever seen. The storyline lacked heart, the pacing was off, and the emotional core that usually defines a Disney movie was nowhere to be found. But the most shocking part of all was Gal Gadot's performance. Her acting was stiff and unconvincing, completely devoid of the warmth or depth that the character required. It was painfully clear that she was miscast, and her presence only dragged the film further down.
What makes it worse is the fact that this movie tried to build on a beloved original - and failed miserably. Instead of honoring what made the original special, it felt like a hollow imitation, filled with glossy visuals but no soul. It was not just a letdown - it was almost offensive to fans who hold the original dear.

This one was unique to where it was neither. And for something the main actor Rachel Zegler claimed was this grand a new telling of Snow White, this was just a repeat of the original just with worst songs.
There has been many, MANY recreations of Snow white and I think someone needs to say it, this one is NOT the most creative.
Just because you add some new songs and make the prince into a bland robin hood does not make this a retelling and nor does that make it imaginative in the slightest.
Disney failed on multiple levels with this one. Most of the music was awful, sloppily put together, and hard to listen to. I also argue that the only songs that were good was the two they kept from the original and even then the performances were so hard to watch.
Its rare that Disney picks bad actors but Zeglar was not the best Snow white. She just seem to be there to do a job and not a good one. Zeglar seemed to be phoning in her performance especially since she has done better in the past. While on the other hand, Gal Gabot seem to be trying TOOO hard to make up for Zeglar's I don't care I just want my Disney moment attitude. Not to mention the costume designs were so forgettable, I did even release that the evil queen wore sequins and snow whites custom looked like it lost color in the wash till many people pointed it out. (at least with CINDERELLA, which was a word for word remake, we remember that jaw-droppingly beautiful ball gown and step mothers customs).
When we have gotten so many good retelling like the HUNTSMAN and MIRROR MIRROR, They seemed confused and maybe even mind-boggled about how to make this a new and exciting telling. This film so badly and desperately wanted to be different while make no real attempts. It not only confused itself, actors, and directors but the audience too. Which I want to go back to CINDERELLA, LITTLE MERMAID and THE LION KING were all successful and were all word for word remakes.
What made the original story a classic was the heart, love and simplicity of the character. Snow White herself wasn't this great or grand character but it was the magic behind her childlike wonder that everyone relates too.

Of course the reason is alway's money. A remake is an easy, low risk cash cow. (Or so Disney thought)
If they had stuck to the original story ,it could have been a success, with modern CGI and live action to recreate the classic.
Instead they decided to make changes, for no other reason, than because they could and that immediately jars (if you're fond of the original)
I digress
What's good about the film ?
Zegler can sing and does play the role competently .
Gal Gadot looks good (too good - see below)
Some of the music is nice.
What's not so good
Absurd when the mirror lies about who's the fairest of them, all. Gadot is miscast , they needed someone of Meryl Streep's age and acting ability for the roie.
Gadot lacks both acting and singing ability.
The film jumps about story wise (which ties in with having to re-edit after bad PR)

Meant to modernize the fairy tale, the reworked story instead comes off as lifeless, with shallow characters and forced dialogue.
Rachel Zegler's performance as the titular princess is especially disappointing; while her singing voice shines, she never truly embodies the warmth or innocence fans expect.
Meanwhile, the CGI-once a Disney hallmark-feels distractingly cheap, from artificial forests to awkwardly reimagined dwarfs. Even the film's musical numbers, usually a highlight of these remakes, are marred by bland, forgettable songs that do little to recapture the enchanting spirit of the original.

The script was incredibly messy, and the acting was poor. Rachel Zegler was great for the most part and had a wonderful singing voice, but Gal Gadot was the worst Evil Queen I've ever seen. And Jonathan's outfits were hideous. The romance between Jonathan and Snow was supposed to be improved upon, but somehow made worse. The choreography was non existent, especially because this is a Disney musical. Some of the songs were good, but the lack of an interesting setting to them was it's downfall.

Had it been described as a fairy tale inspired by Snow White, that would have been more accurate.
The Story
The first 15 minutes are pure filler - the backstory doesn't appear in the original and seems to serve only to stretch the runtime. Throughout the movie, there are many filler scenes that either didn't exist in the original or were heavily altered.
The ending makes no sense - the viewer is never told how Snow White gets the information she suddenly has.
Rachel Zegler aka Snow White
I can't judge her singing abilities as I watched the German dubbed version. I'm also unfamiliar with her previous acting work. In this film, however, every movement and action feels a bit stiff. What really got on my nerves was her ""pouty"" facial expression. It felt neither princess-like nor professional - more like a sulking child.
Dialogue
The word choices in the dialogues don't seem aimed at a younger audience. The flat joke from the ""Prince/Robber"" Jonathan - ""I'm Jonathan, Princess. Just Jonathan, not Princess."" - felt completely out of place.
Visuals
The magic of a fairy tale is missing, as is the warmth that Snow White should radiate.
The entire setting feels bleak, and many elements appear misplaced.
As for the animated dwarfs - I won't even go into detail. In my opinion, they should have cast actors with dwarfism. The head-to-body ratio of the animated dwarfs is awful.
Overall, this film - viewed objectively - belongs in the B-movie category you'd find for $1.99. At least then, you know what to expect. A shame about the $250 million that this product supposedly cost.",2.0,2025-03-30,3,0,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

I don't know how Marc Webb failed so miserably because Spiderman 1 and 500 Days were both amazing movies. Fun, funny, and the two romantic leads in those movies had crazy good chemistry. Like, really good. But he also did TASM2 and that was terrible. So, it's a hit and miss with him.

Not going to personally attack anyone other than Disney and directors on this one as they where ultimatly responsible for script, who plays what and and how the story is told.
My problem 2:
What where those animations? Disney has one of the largest animation studios in the world and some how they ended up to reverting to early 2000's standards? I mean the dwarves literary looked like the where plucked from an 100% animated movie and copy/pasted into a live action capture.

tt6208148,rw10414465,honest_rating,It could be good.,"The actress and the movie were actually good; however, the casting director failed to select the right people to complete the ensemble. While the film had potential, its execution suffered due to casting choices that didn't align well with the characters or the storyline. A well chosen cast plays a crucial role in elevating a movie, bringing characters to life in a way that feels authentic and emotionally engaging. Unfortunately, in this case, the supporting cast fell short, which impacted the overall viewing experience.
A great movie is not just about a strong lead performance. While the actress did an excellent job, delivering a compelling and convincing portrayal of her character, the supporting actors failed to bring the same level of depth and believability. This lack of cohesion among the cast members can make a movie feel disjointed and prevent audiences from fully immersing themselves in the story. Even with a well-written script and solid direction, weak casting choices can create an imbalance that makes it harder for viewers to connect with the film on a deeper level. Casting is an art that requires a keen eye for talent, chemistry, and suitability. A casting director's job is to ensure that each actor embodies their character in a way that enhances the film's vision. When this process is not handled with precision, it can result in performances that feel forced, awkward, or unconvincing. This is particularly true in films where character relationships play a significant role in the storytelling. If the chemistry between characters doesn't feel natural, it can make even the best-written dialogue fall flat.",,2025-03-29,2,6,2025-04-11 16:22:24,0

Rachel Zegler's casting initially felt like a misstep to me based on appearance alone, but I have to admit, her singing was phenomenal. Her vocal delivery added warmth and depth to the role. Gal Gadot, on the other hand, was a perfect fit for the Evil Queen - her elegance and commanding presence made her both mesmerising and menacing.

That said, I do miss the inclusion of ""Some Day My Prince Will Come"" - it's such an iconic part of the original, and its absence left a noticeable gap in the nostalgic feel of the film.

Snow White is not Mulan or any other warrior character. Every Disney princess has her own unique traits, and forcing the same personality onto all of them is a mistake.

Additionally, the actress portraying the evil queen delivers a poor performance, as if she's simply reading from a script. Her facial expressions remain unchanged, and her delivery is flat and unconvincing.

tt6208148,rw10413123,imdbfan-5737377658,Disney's Snow White Falls Flat,"I went into Disney's new live-action Snow White remake expecting big things, but what I got was one of the most disappointing films I've ever had the misfortune of sitting through. As much as I understand the need for a new take on an old favorite story, this adaptation goes so far off the map from the center of the original that it's barely even the same story anymore. From bad choices in story to subpar acting, this film is a complete letdown.

To begin with, the script is a catastrophe. Instead of sticking to the timeless fairy tale, the makers of the movie decided to inject time-worn contemporary themes that end up feeling imposed and not natural. Snow White has been a story of compassion, determination, and the triumph of good over evil, but this retelling strips the magic from it and replaces it with clichéd and unoriginal dialogue. All the magic, the whimsy, and emotional richness that rendered the animated film classic so a gem are here.

Even the performances fail to stem the disappointment. The leading actress lacks presence strong enough to service such a larger-than-life figure, serving up a lifeless and indifferent performance. Snow White is intended as a warm, innocent character here she comes off as mundane and uninspirational. The cast chemistry is non-existent, which makes it difficult to believe in any of the relationships. The villain, usually a standout in any Disney film, is reduced to an afterthought of a caricature and lacks the menace and grandeur of the original Evil Queen.

Visually, the film is underwhelming too. Disney is known for gorgeous cinematography and top-notch special effects, and this film falls far short of that. The CGI is spotty, with some of the scenes being partially done or looking overly artificial. The costume design, an opportunity to pay respect to the original while adding new creative energy, is uninspired and dull. The setting, which should resemble a magical fairy tale world, feels instead stale and lifeless.

Perhaps the most disappointing is the music-or, rather, the lack of memorable music. The original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs had a soundtrack full of classic songs that have stood the test of time. This one, though, fails to create any really magical musical moments. The few that are there are forgettable, lacking the emotional resonance and charm of the classic tunes. The decision to cut or recreate beloved songs was a basic flaw that removes a critical level of nostalgia and emotional impact.

Even the seven dwarfs, one of the greatest things about the original film, are ruined. Their personality, charm, and humor are stripped away and replaced with flat characters that serve no purpose in the story. Instead of being a highlight, they are an afterthought, and it is surprising given how integral they are to the story.

This movie fails overall as both an actual adaptation and as a quality film in itself. It lacks all the heart, charm, and magic that made the original so integral to our culture. Instead, it's cynical, soulless attempt at cashing in on nostalgia and disregarding what made the story work in the first place. Disney has had some success with live-action remakes in the past, but Snow White is a case in point of what happens when a studio prioritizes following trends over conveying a good story.

If you're a fan of the original, I'd recommend skipping this entirely. It's a waste of time, a waste of potential, and a complete disappointment. Hopefully, Disney will learn from this failure and start treating their classics with the respect they deserve. Until then, I'll be rewatching the 1937 animated masterpiece to cleanse my palate.

Use your creativity, but don't ruin our movies. Classics are classics for a reason!!!

A minority will laud Disney's revisionist version. The majority of the (potential) audience will mourn their departure from the wonders of the original. Little more to be said on that subject.
One positive note comes in the performance of Gal Gadot (which saves the musical from a one star rating). She is excellent as the evil step mother lusting to preserve her rule. Some may criticize her performance as lacking ""range,"" but that is the nature of this archetype.
Gadot plays the evil temptress adroitly: alluring, deceptive, cunning, and vindictive. Kudos to Gadot for being a bright/dark light in an otherwise disappointing film.",2.0,2025-03-25,5,1,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

Her plan to get rid of Snow White is so convoluted that it borders on ridiculous. And don't even get me started on the prince, who has no personality whatsoever and falls in love with Snow White purely because of her looks.

While I'll admit the animation was groundbreaking for its time, it hasn't aged particularly well. The pacing is sluggish, the musical numbers are forgettable, and the humor feels forced.

The acting of the two leads was uncomfortable to watch, and the Queen's stiff performance made her as the main antagonist look comically ridiculous. Her behavior logic was also baffling. What does beauty equal power mean? And how could she starve her subjects to death but still be more fit to be their queen because she's ruthless (and they actually accepted her)? Snow White was grinding her teeth, with eyes burning with a vengeful fire, and her gaze pierced through the screen and chilled me to the bone. But her lines were all about love and cowardice. The character behavior logic was handled very carelessly. It's understandable for a fairy tale, but the whole film kept elevating the value, which was very disjointed. The use of CGI effects from the second act onwards was excessive. The third act turned the whole film into a comedy at full speed. They set up that the Queen had magic powers for a long time, but in the end, she could only control flowers and summon a sword from the void, and had a lightning teleportation spell. (Why didn't she just kill the heroine with lightning?) The Queen knew that the poisoned apple could only be cured by a true love's kiss, but she didn't immediately kill the male lead wearing the princess necklace (What? Do you think a dead princess can find another true love?). She said she would freeze the male lead to death, but she didn't even take off his clothes, and the rope was easily untied. The whole film tried to be both deep and childlike, which was very unconvincing. Apart from the singing and dancing (even the choreography was very bad), there wasn't much to watch.

First, let's talk about the script-if you can call it that. The film is so obsessed with ""modernizing"" the story that it strips away everything that made Snow White charming in the first place. Instead of a timeless fairy tale about kindness and overcoming adversity, we get a bland, preachy slog filled with forced dialogue and a protagonist who is about as likable as a soggy piece of toast.
The visuals? Disappointing. For a movie with Disney's budget, I expected something magical. Instead, the CGI looks rushed, and the film's overall aesthetic feels more like a low-budget streaming release than a major theatrical event. Gone is the whimsical artistry that made the original animation so iconic.
The performances don't save it either. The lead actress delivers a flat, uninspired performance, seemingly more interested in lecturing the audience than bringing Snow White to life. And don't get me started on the dwarfs-or rather, the lack thereof. Their replacements feel like an afterthought, completely missing the charm and heart that made the original characters so beloved.
Disney's attempts to ""reimagine"" this classic have resulted in a film that has neither the heart of the original nor the creativity to stand on its own. It's a lifeless, soulless attempt at storytelling that alienates fans while failing to attract a new audience.

On top of all the valid criticisms elsewhere that had been made, it generally lacked in every department. The costumes and makeup were cheap looking and/or inconsistent. The lighting was either a blue filter in the kingdom making it feel like a medieval cop show, or a pee-colored yellow tinge whenever Snow White was around the dwarves. The only time there was actual filming on location in a real forest, the lighting and sound was noticeably different, which made it look like a blatant re-shoot (even if it wasn't).

The ending is also unbelievably bad, to the point it's a little insulting to our intellect, as it was so obviously re-written, probably multiple times.

The dwarves sneak into the castle to do ...nothing except appear.

The bandits sneak into the castle to do...practically nothing except appear.

Snow White saves the day all on her own ...by remembering people's names from a long time ago, and the queen's guards turn against the queen. The queen has a small BF and just sort of magically dies (or gets trapped? It's not super clear).

From the uninspired script to the lifeless performances, this film fails in every conceivable way. But perhaps its biggest downfall is its lead actress, Rachel Zegler, who delivers one of the most unconvincing, charisma-free performances in recent memory.

Zegler's take on Snow White is completely devoid of charm, warmth, or even basic believability. She sleepwalks through the role with an air of disinterest, as if she'd rather be anywhere else. Instead of embodying the grace and innocence of the classic character, she comes across as smug and detached, making it impossible to root for her. Her line delivery is flat, her expressions are forced, and there's no emotional depth to her portrayal. Even in moments that are supposed to be heartfelt, her performance feels robotic and insincere.

It doesn't help that the film itself is a mess. The script strips away Snow White's iconic qualities and replaces them with generic, uninspired ""girlboss"" dialogue that feels more like a parody than an actual character arc. The cinematography is dull, the CGI looks cheap, and the supporting cast is just as forgettable as the lead. The original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a masterpiece of animation and storytelling-this remake, by contrast, is a lifeless, soulless husk that seems embarrassed to be associated with its source material.

Ultimately, Snow White is yet another example of Disney's inability to recapture the magic of its classics.

If there is one thing Snow White has proven is remakes are only being done because Hollywood is running out of ideas. Go read some books again and make movies based on those books. It's just crazy that instead of using their imaginations and creating something original, they are ruining classic films. I'm just over it.",1.0,2025-04-05,9,4,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

The original Snow White is a beloved classic, full of charm, wonder, and timeless storytelling, but this version strips away everything that made it special. The casting choices, changes to the iconic characters, and overall tone feel forced rather than organic. Instead of honoring the original, it seems more concerned with pushing an agenda than delivering a magical experience.
The visuals are lackluster, the performances feel uninspired, and the heartwarming magic that made Disney great is nowhere to be found. This isn't just a disappointing remake.

Her performance falls flat in almost every other aspect. Her line delivery lacks the depth and menace needed for such an iconic role, making her character feel more like a cartoonish exaggeration than a truly intimidating force.
One of the biggest issues with Gadot's acting is her emotional range-or lack thereof. Rather than bringing a nuanced, layered villain to life, her performance comes across as forced and unnatural. Instead of exuding an effortless aura of wickedness, her delivery feels stiff and overly rehearsed. The Evil Queen should command the screen with a chilling presence, but Gadot's portrayal feels more like a parody, as if she's trying too hard to be menacing without actually achieving it.
Another glaring flaw is how she handles the dialogue.",1.0,2025-03-25,10,5,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

First off, the script is a mess. The film takes excessive liberties with the classic tale, stripping away its charm and replacing it with a dull, uninspired narrative that feels forced and preachy. The dialogue is laughably bad, making it impossible to take the characters seriously.
The casting choices are questionable at best. The lead performance lacks the warmth and charisma needed for the role, making it hard to connect with the character. The supporting cast is equally forgettable, delivering wooden performances that only add to the film's lack of emotional depth.
Visually, the movie looks like a cheap CGI overload. Instead of bringing the fairy tale to life, the effects look artificial and unconvincing, making scenes feel lifeless rather than magical. Even the costume and set designs fail to impress, looking uninspired and generic.
To top it off, the pacing is horrendous. The film drags in some parts and rushes through others, making it feel both boring and incoherent at the same time. Any attempt at humor falls flat, and there's no real sense of adventure or wonder-just a long, tedious experience that leaves you checking the time.
Overall, Snow White is an absolute disaster. It's an insult to the original story, a waste of talent, and a complete failure in filmmaking. Save yourself the time and skip this one.",1.0,2025-03-26,18,2,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

Oh my gosh It was unbelievable, but I finally watched the movie in the cinemas and I must admit this film is way better than I expected. Rachel zegler does a phenomenal job as snow white and I think all the new songs are really great. She has a fantastic singing voice in my opinion. I love order new addition scenes. And I really do feel like they expanded and developed a world better than I could have ever imagined it to do.
The cinematography individuals were absolutely stunning. In my opinion, oh my gosh, the colours, the vibrancy delighting it all looks amazing, dude.
I like some of the new characters. They are more less supporting characters. They don't do a whole lot but they do their jobs supporting snow whites. I also do feel like galgado's does a great job at the which people hated her for some reason, saying her acting with stiff. Yeah, she has 1 or 2 awkward moments. But overall, it's more less faithful to the original smell white, which now the only problem I have. With the movie is 2 aspects, the 7 dwarfs. I do think that divisional presentation is faithful, but I do feel a bit mixed on the whole idea of using cgi. Instead of actually hiring little people to play The Doors, I know there's a whole backlash of controversy over that involving peat to think it's buts, it is what it is. I also feel like the ending was very anti. Climactic, it just sort of ended. I expected a big battle in the final act of the first original film in 1937. It was quite dark with the 7 dwalls doing what they did. But in this original new movie, the ending while it's really good And it's very fine.

tt6208148,rw10418461,imdbfan-3078072892,A complete disaster,"I honestly cannot believe I wasted my time watching this movie. I went in with at least some hope that it would be entertaining, if not great, but I was completely let down in every possible way. The writing, the acting, the direction-everything about this film was just painfully bad. It felt like no one involved actually cared about making a good movie, and it shows.
Let's start with the story - or lack thereof.
The plot was a complete mess from start to finish. It had zero coherence, and I still don't fully understand what was supposed to be happening. It felt like the writers threw together a bunch of random scenes without any effort to make them connect. The pacing was atrocious-some scenes dragged on forever while others jumped ahead so fast that I had no idea what was going on. Every time I thought, ""Okay, maybe this will start making sense,"" the movie somehow got even worse.
The dialogue was laughably bad. Every conversation felt forced and unnatural, as if the actors were just reading lines off a script with no emotion. There were so many cringe-worthy one-liners that it almost felt like a parody of itself. And don't even get me started on the pointless exposition dumps-characters constantly explaining things that made no difference to the plot, probably because the writers had no idea how to tell a story naturally.
The acting? Absolutely dreadful.
I don't know if it's the actors' fault or if they were just given horrible direction, but not a single performance was convincing. The main lead was completely emotionless, delivering lines like they were reading a grocery list. The supporting cast wasn't any better-either they were overacting so much that it became unintentionally funny, or they looked so bored that I wondered if they were being held hostage on set.
I've seen better performances in school plays. Even the more experienced actors in the cast seemed like they had given up halfway through. It's as if they realized they signed up for a disaster but were already under contract, so they just went through the motions.
The cinematography and editing were a joke.
Visually, the movie looked cheap and uninspired. The lighting was flat, the color grading was inconsistent, and the camerawork was just lazy. Half the time, it felt like the camera operator didn't know where to focus. Some scenes were way too dark, others were way too bright-there was no consistency whatsoever.
And the editing? It felt like someone randomly cut scenes together without watching the final product. Transitions were jarring, action sequences were choppy and confusing, and sometimes it felt like entire chunks of the story were missing. It was honestly painful to watch.
The special effects were embarrassingly bad.
I don't expect every movie to have Marvel-level CGI, but if you can't afford decent effects, just don't use them. The CGI in this film looked like something from a 1990s video game-completely unrealistic and distracting. Instead of adding to the movie, the bad effects ruined any immersion. And when practical effects were used, they were just as bad-fake-looking props, terrible costume design, and laughable makeup work.
The soundtrack was forgettable at best, irritating at worst.
A good soundtrack can elevate even a mediocre movie, but this one did the opposite. The background music was generic, completely out of place in some scenes, and way too loud in others. There were moments where the music was supposed to create tension, but instead, it just made the scene even more ridiculous.
The worst part? It takes itself WAY too seriously.
If this movie had at least acknowledged how bad it was, it could have been an enjoyable ""so bad it's good"" kind of experience. But no. It actually tries to be deep and meaningful, which makes it even more unbearable. There were multiple moments where it was obvious that the director wanted some kind of emotional impact, but the execution was so bad that I just ended up laughing instead.
Final Verdict: Avoid this movie at all costs.
I honestly don't know who this movie was made for. It's not smart enough for people who like intelligent films, it's not fun enough for people who just want mindless entertainment, and it's definitely not competent enough for anyone with basic filmmaking standards. It fails in every way possible, and I cannot think of a single redeeming quality.

Let's start with the CGI-simply put, it's awful. The dwarfs look like they belong in an early 2000s video game, and the enchanted forest has all the charm of a cheap theme park attraction. With Disney's massive budget, there's no excuse for visuals this underwhelming.
Then there's the dialogue, which is all over the place. It awkwardly bounces between old-fashioned fairytale speak and modern lingo, making it feel disjointed and unnatural. Snow White's speeches about empowerment come across as forced, while the Evil Queen's lines sound like they were written by a bot stuck in the past.
And the music? An absolute disaster. The songs are forgettable at best, and at worst, cringeworthy. There's even an out-of-nowhere rap battle between Snow White and the Evil Queen that made me physically wince.

Rachel Zegler brings effort to the title role, but the script strips away Snow White's innocence in favor of a forced, modernized persona that lacks emotional depth. Gal Gadot's Evil Queen is similarly underwhelming, missing the menace and charisma the role demands.
Visually, the film falters with uncanny CGI dwarfs that feel more like digital placeholders than characters, diminishing any sense of warmth or nostalgia. The soundtrack is equally disappointing-forgettable new songs and uninspired remakes of the classics add little emotional impact. As The New Yorker notes, the film fails to capture the soul of the original, while The New York Post calls it a ""pointless and awkward"" experience that quickly fades from memory.

I thought Wicked was amazing and I gave it a 9 out of 10 and they spent 150 million to make it. They advertised well and I really wanted to see it.
Snow White was the complete opposite form of advertising so I went to go see it not expecting the best movie but I never knew it could be this bad.
Pasek and Paul wrote music for a Moana character in all belt voice and nothing for the soprano range. Snow White is supposed to be classy and elegant like Cinderella and they took the wrong approach. We saw strong voices with Elsa, Moana, Asha, Jasmine, and others.. they should have made Snow White young and sweet like she was originally portrayed; the music should have supported that.

tt0029583,rw5860167,SAMTHEBESTEST,Disney's Cheerfully Distasteful Remake of Their Biggest Hit Ever,"Snow White (2025) :
Movie Review -
Disney is approaching its centennial, and over these 100 years, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) continues to be the BIGGEST HIT they ever produced (109 million tickets sold in North America). Unsure why they decided to redo the iconic film after 90 years, only to tarnish their own legacy. Snow White is a cheerful movie, until you reach the climax, which kills it more than the poisoned apple ever could. Even though it's a borrowed tale, you'll observe the alterations and additions in the script and wonder, ""who approved these clichés?""
In the opening scene, if the younger version of Snow White appears more beautiful than the adolescent version of Snow White, then you've started off on the wrong foot, mate. If the magic mirror reveals that Rachel Zegler is more beautiful and fairer than Gal Gadot, then you certainly have a problematic product on your hands. If your movie doesn't conclude with the ""true love kiss,"" you've really failed it. If the Evil Queen can be vanquished through conversation, then I have no interest, Marc brother.
The tale of Snow White, as everyone knows, revolves around Snow White (both externally and internally) who is turned into a servant by the Evil Queen. The Evil Queen has taken great pride in being the fairest of all, but her arrogance is shattered when the magic mirror reveals that Snow White is the fairest. The Queen now desires Snow White, also known as the Princess, to be dead, but she is granted life by her killer and is left to reside in an enchanted forest. The princess seeks refuge in the sole house she spots, owned by seven dwarfs, each representing a different human emotion-Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey. The princess is looking for her father but the dwarfs ask her to stay here, stay safe; will she listen?
In contrast to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, this remake portrays the Prince in a new way-as a Rebel, specifically speaking. Why the hell did you do that? As stated earlier, the true Love's kiss seems ineffective as it doesn't create that singular ideal moment of a ""perfect Happy ending."" The film runs longer from there. Snow White's musical pieces are effective at certain moments, but others can be very dull. Certain dialogues are also not positioned effectively. Quite reminiscent of the legendary conversation between Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart about ""how to whistle"" in ""To Have and Have Not"" (1944), our Snow White instructs Dopey and the other dwarfs on the same topic, namely, ""how to whistle."" That appeared adorable, however. Additionally, numerous scenes in the movie appeared delightful and joyful, including the introduction of animals, the opening song featuring the seven dwarfs, and the house cleaning sequence. On the downside, the film overlooked some stunning scenes from the original, with my favorite being Snow White's joyful gathering with birds and animals at home.
Regarding performances, I think Snow White had the potential to be much better than how the actors have portrayed it. Rachel Zegler appears excessively white and fair, yet she was decent overall. Gal Gadot's accent appeared more English this time, surprisingly, yet the character didn't resonate effectively. Andrew Burnap portrays the new character, who, despite his satisfactory to reasonable performance, appears entirely out of place in the context. The backing of Ansu Kabia, Patrick Page, and Hadley Fraser was barely perceptible, while all those seven dwarfs appeared cute on occasion but visually unappealing at other times. One cannot be so childish with a $250 million budget film.
Snow White lacks captivating music and visual charm, which are essential for any live-action adaptation. Disney is undoubtedly running low on concepts, which is why they are recreating many of their legendary blockbusters. I firmly believe that Snow White wasn't the appropriate choice for the remake era. The visual effects are even worse than you'd imagine, and the casting of Zegler and Gadot in specific roles is surely one of the biggest F-ups in recent memory. Marc Webb's contemporary take on the cult classic nearly won me over; indeed, Disney's Snow White was almost a winner, until it lost to its own potential and legacy. The final 20-25 minutes of the film have turned it into a terrible remake by far; I mean, it completely lost me during that part. If there were no Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, then Snow White could have possibly worked for me. But what would Disney have been without Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs? I suppose nothing. However, Disney without Snow White would have had ""no impact"" on the world. So, skip watching it if you cherish, admire, and honor the original. Let Disney suffer.

tt6208148,rw10419962,imdbfan-7994936286,An insult to storytelling,"This movie is an absolute mess from start to finish. It takes a beloved classic and completely ruins it, stripping away everything that made Snow White special. Instead of a magical and heartwarming story, we get bad acting, lifeless CGI, and a script so terrible it feels like no one even tried. The whole thing is dull, awkward, and completely lacking in charm.
The people behind this movie clearly didn't care about the original. Instead of respecting the story, they changed everything in a way that feels forced and unnatural. The characters are boring, the dialogue is cringe-worthy, and the pacing is so slow that it feels like a chore to sit through. Worst of all, the so-called ""updates"" take away the heart of the story, leaving behind a hollow, joyless mess.
Visually, it's just as bad. The CGI looks fake, the costumes are uninspired, and nothing about the world feels magical. It's clear that Disney was more focused on making a statement than actually telling a good story. The result? A film that pleases no one-neither fans of the original nor new audiences.
This movie is a complete failure, and Disney should be embarrassed. If you love Snow White, don't waste your time on this disaster. Just watch the original-it's a million times better than this soulless, boring, and unnecessary remake.",1.0,2025-03-30,4,1,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

The biggest issue is the lack of character build up. Snow White herself feels like a blank slate, with little development to make us care about her journey. The supporting cast is ... well unsupporting, and their relationships lack the warmth and charm that made the original so timeless.
The acting doesn't help either. Instead of pulling me into the story, it kept taking me out of it. Whether it was stiff dialogue delivery or an overall lack of chemistry between characters, I found myself more distracted than engaged.
Then there's the storyline, which seems unsure of what it wants to be. It doesn't inspire joy or wonder. It leans into a heavy handed, almost revolutionary narrative that feels more like a Che Guevara fanfiction than a fairy tale. While classic Disney movies balance dark moments with heartwarming ones, this film tips too far into unsettling territory. It's definitely not a kids movie anymore, my children and some in the audience got scared at different points without a reward for it.
Ultimately, this re-imagining strips away the magic and leaves behind something that feels empty and confused. If you're looking for nostalgia or even just a fun adventure, this isn't it.",4.0,2025-04-01,4,1,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

The Evil Queen is supposed to be menacing, regal, and dripping with arrogance, but Gadot delivers a performance so wooden and lifeless that she comes across more like a bored runway model than a terrifying villain. Her line delivery is flat, her expressions are painfully forced, and her attempts at being sinister feel like a bad joke.

Her accent, which wasn't an issue in other roles, becomes incredibly distracting here. Instead of sounding commanding, she sounds awkward, as if she's struggling to deliver each sentence with the right tone. Any attempt at exuding power or vanity falls flat because she simply lacks the depth and intensity to pull it off. The original Evil Queen from Disney's 1937 classic was chilling and unforgettable-Gadot's version is the exact opposite, forgettable and uninspired.

Visually, she looks the part, but that's where the positives end. No matter how much the film tries to make her appear menacing, her presence is weak. She doesn't dominate the screen; she gets lost in it. Even her evil laughter, which should send chills down the audience's spine, sounds awkward and unconvincing. It's as if she herself doesn't believe in her own performance.

With such an iconic villain to portray, this should have been an easy win, but Gadot turns it into one of the weakest portrayals in Disney history. Instead of elevating the role, she drags it down, making the Evil Queen feel less like a formidable threat and more like a last-minute casting mistake. If this was supposed to be a modern, fresh take on the character, it completely missed the mark.",1.0,2025-03-22,39,8,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

Rachel Ziegler was a perfect choice to play Snow White. Her voice was excellent and I couldn't imagine anyone else playing Snow White once I saw her performance.

Snow White's character was something to admire. Holding onto her Father's ideals was something to be applauded - not rejected because it wasn't the same as the 1937 version.

There still was an evil queen (Gal Godot - fantastic) who was defeated - not by 1 person but by the community. Again - a great lesson to be learned.

Maybe the script written by 10 year olds with the repeating dialogue about a rose and a diamond over and over again. Perhaps the fact that that Jonathan sings about ""Princess problems"" and then he catches an arrow to save Snow White. Makes sense, yes. Or is it the fact that the late king and queen made pies for the town and thus fact kept the people going, because that's just enough.

I don't even want to start on the acting, ugh. The main actress is so unbelievable and fake, it is hard to watch. She really tries to act kind, lifting her eyebrows, but that really doesn't help much. Her singing was okay, nothing special, not comparable to the original 1937. The evil queen is just funny, not more than that, as she locks the prisoners in the dungeon that has a clear way out. And her evilness is really not there, I was more concerned about her than about Snow White.

But I think the cream de la creme was the AI editing of the movie and terrible CGI. It felt like I was browsing through the cringe AI art online. The dwarves looked just terrifying and unrealistic, so you want to close your eyes, just not to see them again. The background was just a green screen and some plastic items thrown around if needed.

The costumes were just bad, there is nothing else to say, like they were from cheap carnival shop.

I think that the laziness of the production and overuse of an AI, what killed the movie at its core. I hope that the movie industry will learn the lesson and never produce anything in this format ever again, because that would be just disrespectful to the cinema.

First and foremost, the lifeless script is a major issue. The characters lack depth, the dialogues feel artificial, and there's no emotional connection with the audience. Key elements of the fairy tale have been altered, but rather than making the story more engaging, these changes strip it of its essence.
The performances aren't particularly impressive either. Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White lacks charisma and inspiration, making the character feel ordinary and at times even unlikable. Additionally, the characters replacing the seven dwarfs are weakly designed and serve no meaningful purpose in the story.

The CGI looked like it was rendered on a potato, especially the 'magical creatures' that resembled mutated hamsters. The dialogue? Painfully clichéd. I swear, the script must have been written by an AI trained on rejected Hallmark movie lines.
And Snow White herself? A personality vacuum. She delivered every line with the same monotone drone, like she was reading a grocery list. The prince, or whatever he was supposed to be, had the charisma of a damp dishcloth. The 'evil queen' was less menacing and more like a disgruntled customer service representative.
The 'modernized' twists they shoehorned in felt forced and awkward. The musical numbers were excruciating, and the choreography looked like a middle school talent show gone wrong. The plot?

The characters feel hollow, the visuals lack the warmth and artistry of the original, and the storyline takes unnecessary liberties that add nothing of value.
It's as if the filmmakers were more interested in making a statement than in telling a compelling story. The emotional connection to Snow White and the dwarfs is missing, and the forced changes to the narrative feel more like an attempt to rewrite history rather than bring a beloved tale to life.

tt6208148,rw10427057,olivlemay,"Disney's Snow White: A Mediocre, Soul-less Reimagining that Misses the Mark","The new Snow White movie is a perfect representation of the decline in quality of Disney productions over the past few years. From the very first minutes, the viewer is struck by the total lack of soul and authenticity in this film, which feels like just another product in a line of uninspired creations. The special effects are particularly disappointing, with visuals that lack any real magic. Instead of enchanting, the digital imagery has the opposite effect, at times even being jarring due to its lack of fluidity and coherence.
As for actress Rachel Ziegler, who plays Snow White, her performance is frankly lacking. She delivers a portrayal without nuance, far from the grace and depth expected of such an iconic role. She seems lost rather than emotional, and her acting is surprisingly flat, never managing to captivate or move the audience. It's a casting failure for such an important character.
Unfortunately, it doesn't get any better with Gal Gadot, who plays the Evil Queen. While the actress is often praised for her action roles, here she feels completely out of place with the tone of the film. Her portrayal lacks subtlety, swinging between the grotesque and overly theatrical, never managing to impose a true sense of menace or to embody a villain worthy of such a role. Her performance comes across as artificial and fails to add any depth to this iconic character.
What I don't understand is how such a massive filmmaking company like Disney could ever approve such a mediocre film. It's hard to fathom how a studio with so many resources and so much history could release something so lacking in both quality and creativity.
It's becoming increasingly hard to ignore that Disney has been in a particularly low phase for the past decade. After the botched reimaginings of its animated classics into live-action films, the studio seems to have lost its unique craftsmanship, its magic, and the sense of adventure and wonder that made its early masterpieces so charming. Today, Disney films all feel the same-devoid of real soul, relying on flashy but empty special effects, and featuring characters without depth. This Snow White is sadly just another example of how Disney seems to have run out of creativity, opting to capitalize on its franchises without caring about artistic quality.",1.0,2025-04-02,5,2,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

It's like they tried to reinvent the wheel and ended up with a triangle. Not worth the time.
Let's start with the characters. Snow White herself, played with little nuance, comes across more like a background character in her own story. She lacks the emotional depth or personality needed to carry the film, and unfortunately, the writing doesn't do her any favors either. The dialogue is stiff, forced, and at times painfully cringe-worthy, trying to sound modern and empowering but ending up awkward and shallow.
The Evil Queen, usually the highlight of any Snow White adaptation, is reduced here to a caricature. Her motivations are unclear, her presence is inconsistent, and the performance feels half-baked.

Instead of honoring the charm and emotional depth that define Disney classics, the studio opted for drastic changes that stripped away the magic entirely, replacing it with a hollow, cliché-ridden love story. Visually, the film felt shockingly cheap for a Disney production-something that should never be the case given the studio's legacy and resources.
Moving forward, Disney desperately needs to invest in stronger styling, richer world-building, and most importantly, original storylines that offer new twists while respecting what audiences have always loved.

I went in with an open mind-really, I did-but by the time the credits rolled, I was left wondering who greenlit this and why they thought it was a good idea to stretch a sketch into a feature film.
The whole thing starts off with a vibe that's trying way too hard to be clever. You've got Snow White, reimagined as this edgy, modern heroine who's more about snarky one-liners than anything resembling the fairy tale we know.
It's like they handed the script to a room full of improv comics.
The dialogue's packed with pop culture jabs and self-aware winks that might've landed if they'd kept it short and sweet. But at nearly two hours? It's exhausting.
The dwarves, for example, are less characters and more walking punchlines, each one a caricature that feels ripped from a late-night parody.
The songs are catchy for about ten seconds before you realize they're just there to pad the runtime.
I get it-they wanted to flip the script, make it fresh, appeal to a new crowd. But there's a difference between reinventing a classic and turning it into a gag.
Like an SNL bit that's funny for five minutes but keeps dragging on until you're begging for the host to cut to commercial.
Look, if you're expecting a heartfelt story or even a solid satire, you're out of luck. Snow White 2025 is a marathon of smirks that forgets fairy tales are supposed to have a little magic, not just a laugh track.

The Evil Queen should be a figure of terrifying elegance, someone who commands the screen with every glance. Instead, Gadot just... stands there, posing like she's still in a perfume commercial.

I have never gone to see a film purely because of how much backlash it was receiving, but-well-there is a first time for everything. The controversy around Disney's live-action Snow White intrigued me. The outrage, the think pieces, the online vitriol-it all made me wonder what, exactly, people were so furious about.
So I went in with no expectations. No nostalgia bias. No need to defend the original. And I was absolutely blown away.
Let me say this plainly: there is nothing wrong with this film. Nothing. If its message-of strength, compassion, justice, and self-determination-bothers you, then the problem is not with Snow White. The problem is you.
Imagine being upset about a story where a young woman rises to face evil, saves her kingdom, refuses to be passive, finds love without surrendering her independence, and dares to do what is right even when it is dangerous. That is the story this film tells, and it tells it with heart, humor, and visual beauty.
The performances are vibrant, the sets and costumes are lush and imaginative, and the direction is sure-handed. There is joy in this film. A sense of play. A deliberate balance between honoring the classic tale and reinterpreting it for a generation that sees the world through a more inclusive and complex lens.
Were there things that could have been done differently? Certainly. No film is perfect. But the core of this one-its spirit, its message, its visual and emotional execution-is solid. More than solid. It is delightful.
Would I take children to see this? Absolutely. Not only would I take them, I would encourage them to watch the original animated Snow White first and then experience this new version. Let them see how stories evolve over time. Let them see that heroines can grow stronger, villains more nuanced, and messages more resonant.
And if it bothers you that Snow White is not the same as she was in 1937... well, I do not know what to tell you.

I get that Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a classic, but honestly, it does not hold up. The story is ridiculously simple, Snow White has zero personality, and the prince is so irrelevant he might as well not exist. She spends most of the movie singing, cleaning, or being helpless until she falls into a coma-great role model.
The dwarfs are mildly entertaining at first, but their gimmicks get old fast. The only real standout is the Evil Queen, but she barely gets any screen time before meeting a rushed and anticlimactic end.
Visually, I'll give it credit for being impressive for 1937, but the animation feels stiff, and the pacing drags. If you didn't grow up with it, there's really no reason to watch it now. Disney has done way better since.",1.0,2025-03-26,2,0,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

It seems like they completely changed the original story, which makes you wonder-why did they alter so much about such a classic fairytale? Instead of drastically modifying a beloved character like Snow White, maybe it would've made more sense to create a brand-new story with a fresh character who represents those modern values. That way, the original magic of Snow White could have been preserved for those who loved it.

On top of that, the graphics and visual effects in the film feel poorly developed and rushed. For a company like Disney, which used to be known for its breathtaking animation and attention to detail, this is a major letdown.

Honestly, I think Disney is running out of good creative ideas. They seem to rely more and more on reboots and live-action remakes, instead of taking risks with original stories.

This cinematic disaster is so mind-numbingly dull, so aggressively mediocre, that the only reason it gets a 1/10 instead of a 0/10 is because technically the film exists and can be played on a screen.
Story - A Snooze-Fest of Epic Proportions
The plot is about as exciting as watching a rock erode. A girl eats an apple, takes a nap, and gets kissed by a stranger-groundbreaking. The pacing is slower than a snail on sedatives, and the ""twists"" are so predictable they might as well have been written in neon letters saying ""BORING AHEAD.""
Characters - Cardboard Cutouts with Less Personality
Snow White herself is the most lifeless protagonist in history-her only defining trait is ""exists."" The dwarfs? Annoying. The prince? A glorified mannequin. The evil queen is the only one with a shred of charisma, and even she can't save this train wreck.
Visuals - If Dull Had a Face
The animation looks like it was done by someone who had only heard of colors in passing. The forest scenes are a blur of brown and green mush, and Snow White's design is so bland she practically fades into the background. Even the magic mirror looks like it's judging the film's poor choices.
Music - Ear Torture in Disney Form
The songs are forgettable at best, grating at worst. ""Heigh-Ho"" is the only tolerable one, and even that gets ruined by sheer repetition. The rest sound like a choir of sleep-deprived woodland creatures being forced to sing at gunpoint.
Final Verdict - A Crime Against Cinema
Snow White is a soulless, tedious, painfully outdated relic that only serves as proof that not all classics age well. The only thing it's good for is making you appreciate better movies.

tt6208148,rw10392568,zkonedog,A Great Resume-Builder For Zegler-But Ultimately Runs Into The Same Old Disney Live-Action Remake Problems,"Rachel Zegler is one of the great up-and-coming (if not in some aspects ""already arrived"") song-and-dance-picture stars. Her casting as live-action Snow White is as savvy as Emma Watson's Belle in the similar Beauty and the Beast. Unfortunately, Zegler's talent and charm is about all Snow White has going for it, as it runs into all the same problems as so many of the Disney live-action remakes before it.
For a very basic overview, Snow White tells the iconic tale of the titular princess (Zegler) who is pursued by her evil Queen stepmother (Gal Gadot) and finds refuge both with the enigmatic Seven Dwarves and a rebel named Jonathan (Andrew Burnap).
Again: Zegler is a true standout here. The top moments of this movie are her reprising Whistle While You Work and contributing the original song Princess Problems. In those moments, one can understand why this project was greenlit-because they contain some charm.
Alas, Snow White suffers-like the long line of recent Disney animation remakes before it-from the ""why is this necessary?"" and the ""balance between new/old"" problems. The 1937 original ushered in Disney's reign of animation/musical dominance and this one obviously can't hold a candle to that in scope/spectre. So, director Marc Webb tries to infuse some new material-only to have it be an odd mix trying to weave it in with the classic bits.
Of course, Disney's own petty political panderings hurt this production too. Casting real actors as the Seven Dwarves would have made this a more fun/unique experience-but the Mouse House got rattled by a ridiculous ""dwarfism"" controversy and instead went with dwarf-animation. An asinine choice considering the '37 animation in that department is one of Disney's most iconic properties.
So, overall, I view 2025's Snow White as a great resume-builder for Rachel Zegler-and that's about it. This is a movie absolutely screaming to be liked (who doesn't enjoy a magical fairy tale?!) and only Zegler provides a few of those moments. But for the most part, it is uneven bits and bobs of old and new beats stitched together in Frankenstein-fashion.",4.0,2025-03-21,156,147,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

The excessive reliance on CGI, particularly for the seven dwarfs, results in lifeless and unsettling visuals rather than endearing characters. Rachel Zegler's portrayal of Snow White lacks emotional depth, and her chemistry with other characters feels forced, while Gal Gadot's Evil Queen oscillates between overly dramatic and uninspired. The modernized script, which removes the traditional romance in favor of a forced feminist narrative, feels contrived rather than empowering. Additionally, the costumes and set design appear anachronistic, with some elements seeming out of place in a fairy tale setting. The soundtrack, though composed by award-winning musicians, fails to deliver any memorable songs. Ultimately, Snow White is a soulless and uninspired adaptation that loses sight of what made the original a timeless masterpiece.",1.0,2025-03-29,2,0,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

The Evil Queen, while visually striking, has a weak motivation-why does she even need a magic mirror to tell her she's not the fairest? Get a grip!

As for Rachel Zegler, she's undeniably charming and has a screen presence that could've really worked in a faithful adaptation. She's got that classic fairytale look and a voice to match. But instead of building on the timeless appeal of the original story, they chose to reinvent the wheel-and not in a good way.

Personally, the CGI looked downright bad to me. I didn't know about the casting issues before the movie came out, but I think they should have either cast live actors or invested in quality graphics. It turned out worse than expected: not only the dwarves, but also the forest and other scenes looked unconvincing.
A few songs were quite memorable, but by that point I just wanted the movie to end. The actors certainly had to work with what they were given, but it looked like they were just practicing their lines without much involvement. Snowball's speech was unnatural, without emotion. Perhaps another actress could have played her more convincingly, but even a good actor can't save a weak script. Plus, the original version of the film conveyed a genuine naivety, and this feeling was lost here.
Overall, the film feels more like a cheap ""straight to video"" project than an expensive Disney premiere. I've seen much better CGI even in small-budget series, and the acting in them was an order of magnitude better. It's hardly worth spending money on a ticket - unless the kids really insist.

Her singing voice is fantastic, the acting is lovely, and she does what she can with a bad script. Gal Gadot is probably the most praised, and it's well-deserved. She does not deliver a particularly convincing performance in this film. Nevertheless, the first half of the film is certainly approved.

The script is so far from the original that it might have been better to give it a different name and thus avoid a lot of social media chatter and comparisons.

The seven dwarfs are notorious. Wow, the CGI is poor, and it's not that it's badly executed CGI, but it's a dreadful design. It led to scattered laughter in the cinema at the wrong moments. But Dopey is a bit sweet. There are also seven bandits that we need to keep track of. The hunter, who is supposed to take her out into the woods and kill her, seems to be a huge character, but he is not, oh well. This is actually the case throughout the film. Things are set up, and then nothing more happens.

Then there's the prince, yes, he is also not really anything big, and charming is not a word you can use for him, and their chemistry is non-existent.

Snow White saves the day and I was thing ""why were the dwarfs and bandits even included?"" If they had been written out, it wouldn't have made much of a difference. You could have replaced both the hunter and the prince with anyone else because their roles do not matter to the plot.

The script, hopeless design of both costumes and CGI makes Snow White fall flat. But the songs are quite good.

A reimagining of Disney's fairy tale into a live-action version filled with vision and a modern perspective, while firmly retaining the framework of the original Grimm fairy tale.
The storytelling focuses on the development of the main characters, particularly Snow White and the Evil Queen, giving them greater depth than the original. While preserving the romantic and dreamy essence of a fairy tale, it cleverly incorporates elements of power struggles and personal identity.
Rachel Zegler plays Snow White with a beautiful voice and strong performance, portraying a character who embodies both gentleness and resilience.
Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen exudes allure and cruelty, delivering a chilling performance that leaves an impression. However, her role lacks the intensity it deserves, missing the fearfulness and mystique expected from the character.
The visuals are crafted with stunning beauty and imagination, reflecting the essence of a fairy tale. The fantasy world is breathtaking, with vibrant colors and intricate details, especially in the forest scenes and lively animals.
The soundtrack remains a highlight of Disney. The music seamlessly blends classic songs with new melodies, particularly the standout track ""Waiting on a Wish."" The classic ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" is reimagined in a modern, melodious way.
However, the screenplay has noticeable weaknesses. Some parts of the story lack deep emotional pull, and supporting characters are underdeveloped. The seven dwarfs are adorable but have overly limited roles.
The first half of the film captivates with its visuals and emotions, but the second half loses balance with rushed pacing. The ending feels overly simplistic, leaving a sense of disappointment.
Snow White (2025) blends classic elements with contemporary flair and a fresh interpretation in a satisfying way. It may not reach its full potential, but it's a film that both fans of the classic and newer audiences can enjoy.

To start, the plot is a tangled mess of clichés and half-baked ideas. The movie introduces several subplots and characters early on, none of which are developed meaningfully. It feels like the writers threw everything at the wall to see what stuck-and unfortunately, nothing did. The story moves at a sluggish pace, only to rush through important moments, leaving viewers confused and disconnected.

""Snow White"" isn't just a misstep; it's a full-on tumble down the mountain of creativity with every branch of originality smacking it in the face on the way down.

The film is a grim fairy tale, not in the way the Brothers Grimm intended-but in the way that makes you check your watch 30 minutes in and wonder how you're still alive. The magic? Gone. The charm? Non-existent. The dwarfs? Rebranded beyond recognition and drained of any character depth or charm. It's like Disney held a funeral for the source material and then decided to dance on its grave with vague dialogue and recycled CGI.

Snow White herself feels more like a side character in her own story, overshadowed by awkward pacing, dialogue that could've been AI-generated (and not in a good way), and a script so sanitized and soulless it makes cardboard look emotionally complex.

tt6208148,rw10394519,sk-41206,The worst movie of 2025,"Where do I even begin with this trainwreck of a movie? This movie is an absolute dumpster fire, a cinematic disaster so bad it makes Sharknado look like The Godfather. From start to finish, it's a cringe-fest that insults the original fairy tale, the audience's intelligence, and the very concept of storytelling.

First off, the acting. Whoever cast the lead as Snow White must have been blindfolded and throwing darts at a board. Her performance was so wooden, I half-expected her to sprout leaves and turn into a tree. And don't even get me started on the ""charming"" prince-his charisma was so nonexistent, I've seen more chemistry in a middle school science lab. The Evil Queen, supposedly the highlight of the story, was reduced to a cartoonish villain who couldn't intimidate a goldfish. Her iconic ""mirror, mirror"" line was delivered with all the gravitas of someone ordering a latte.

The script? Oh, the script. It's like they handed a group of toddlers crayons and said, ""Write a movie!"" The dialogue was so clunky and awkward, it felt like it was translated through Google Translate-twice. The attempts at humor were painfully unfunny, and the emotional moments fell flatter than a pancake. The writers somehow managed to take a timeless tale and turn it into a snooze-fest that drags on for what feels like an eternity.

And the visuals? Yikes. The CGI was so bad, it looked like it was rendered on a 2005 desktop computer. The dwarfs (or whatever they were trying to pass off as dwarfs) were a visual nightmare, and the ""magical"" forest looked like a screensaver from Windows 95. The costumes were equally atrocious-Snow White's iconic dress looked like it was bought from a Halloween clearance bin.

I walked into the theater hoping for a fresh take on a classic fairytale and left wondering if the writers had even read the original story.

The dialogue feels like it was written by a group chat full of marketing interns trying to be ""empowering"" without understanding character depth. Snow White herself is a charisma vacuum-wooden delivery, zero chemistry with anyone, and about as enchanting as a cold cup of tea. The dwarves? Barely there. And not a single one had a personality beyond ""background extra with a name.""
The CGI looks like it was outsourced to a laptop from 2006, and don't get me started on the songs. One of them rhymed ""dream"" with ""scream"" and honestly, that was fitting. I was screaming internally.

tt6208148,rw10428673,imdbfan-6389879890,The BEST Snow White film adaptation in 88 years!,"I know by me having a positive experience watching this movie will in itself be controversial because of the current general perception of this film and widespread criticism it's receiving in the media.
I'd also like to state my bias. The original 1937 film ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" has been the single most influential movie of my life. It was the first movie I ever saw and really has informed my perception of the world and the creative arts so much so that I chose a career in this industry.
I'd also like to acknowledge and talk about all of the other live action interpretations of Snow White in film, television and on stage over the years. In my opinion the 1981 stage adaptation of the 1937 film by Disney held at Radio City Music Hall (the entire show is available to watch for free on YouTube) was the best version of Snow White post 1937 until 2025! All of the other incarnations of the story (eg. Snow White: A Tale of Terror 1997, Snow White: The Fairest of them all 2001, Mirror Mirror 2012 and Snow White and the Huntsman 2012), I generally found these overly dark and bland not capturing the magic of the original which was whimsical and it created a world effortlessly in which a mirror could talk and dwarfs sang merrily on their way home from work. I know the original film is based on the Fairy Tale by the Brothers Grimm and that in itself is very different from the 1937 film. In terms on what I'm comparing the various incarnations too it is the 1937 film which made Snow White a household name by creating Iconic and unique visuals. The look of the dwarfs, the look of the Evil Queen, Snow White's iconic dress and the hag clutching the apple. These have become legendary images and constantly referenced for almost a century in pop culture and in the media.
With all that said I'll now get into the 2025 ""Snow White"" and why I think, not only does this incarnation do these iconic characters justice. It also respectfully makes nods to the movie that created Walt Disney.
I also think that this version is probably one of the best live action adaptations that Disney has produced ever. It's up there with my personal favourites Alice in Wonderland 2010, 101 Dalmatians 1996 and Cinderella 2015.
This movie is stylised which works for creating this world in which all these legendary characters inhabit. It gives backstory and depth to the characters and really establishes an entire world, which we as audience members have been invited to suspend whatever scepticism we might have and take a bite!!
Rachel Zegler is 23 years old! Of course she's not gonna say all the right things and of course she's gonna put her foot in it a few times while talking about this film but who actually cares! I say give the girl a break! She's young and she's human! I personally think she is one of the things that make this movie really work! Stunning to look at and Stunning to listen to! She also brings depth and heart in a very nuanced portrayal of the titular princess. Gal Gadot grew on me as the evil queen. Initially I thought she was being upstaged by her costumes which I'm obsessed with! Sandy Powell has done it again with incredible wardrobes for the cast. However by her number ""All is Fair"" I was sold on Gadot's portal and it was nice to see the star take a risk and really throw herself into this iconic character which I felt by the end of the film she had me convinced! She was a highlight for me!
Now the dwarfs! I fell in love with them! They were my favourite part of the original film and it was so nice to see a version of ""Snow White"" in which the 7 original named dwarfs return. Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sneezy, Bashful, Sleepy and Dopey were a joy to watch sing and come to life in this film. I liked the fact they were CGI it made them feel real in this stylised world.
The visuals of the film were incredible. Vibrant and colourful which I loved! The rest of the characters were clearly supporting players in an ensemble film that centres around Zegler's Snow White. The love interest was charming but a bit forgettable in the scheme of the film.
I personally hope this has convinced even 1 person to watch the movie because it's really not deserving of the hate it has received.
It was so nice to walk away from a Snow White film feeling the same way I did after watching the 1937 film for the first time.

What was once a groundbreaking animated classic has been stripped of its magic, charm, and soul, leaving behind a dull, lifeless mess that barely resembles the story we once loved.
For a film with such a massive budget, the visuals are shockingly underwhelming. The CGI-heavy forest looks artificial, failing to capture any sense of wonder. The dwarfs-if you can even call them that-are irrelevant, muttering through their lines without any of the personality that made them iconic. The story meanders aimlessly, making the film feel twice as long as it actually is.
It lacks warmth, charm, or depth, making it difficult to care about her journey. Meanwhile, the prince is so painfully dull that he may as well not exist. Even Gal Gadot, a highlight on paper, delivers a disappointingly wooden performance as the Evil Queen, failing to bring the necessary menace to the role.
Perhaps the worst offense is how the film fails to recapture the heart of the original. The songs are forgettable, the story is poorly rewritten, and the emotional beats fall flat. Iconic moments are either removed or so mishandled that they lose their impact entirely.

tt6208148,rw10422768,imdbfan-0904965148,It so bad,"Snow White: A Dull and Outdated Fairy Tale

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is often praised as a groundbreaking animated film, but let's be honest-it's far from perfect. In fact, if you strip away the nostalgia, what's left is a painfully outdated, slow-paced, and uninspiring story that feels like a chore to sit through.

The Weakest Disney Princess?

Snow White herself is, quite frankly, one of the weakest protagonists in Disney history. She has no real personality beyond being sweet and naïve. Her biggest achievements? Cleaning a house, singing to woodland creatures, and eating a poisoned apple like an idiot. Unlike later Disney heroines who show intelligence and strength, Snow White spends most of the movie relying on others to save her.

A Predictable and Boring Plot

The story is as basic as it gets: an evil queen is jealous of Snow White's beauty, so she tries to kill her. That's it. There's no depth, no twists, no real development-just a series of events that happen with little emotional impact. The prince? He appears at the beginning, disappears for most of the movie, then shows up at the end just to kiss a corpse. That's not romantic; it's creepy.

Unfunny and Annoying Side Characters

The Seven Dwarfs are supposed to be the comic relief, but let's be real-half of them are forgettable, and the other half are just irritating. Dopey's exaggerated slapstick humor gets old fast, and Grumpy's constant complaining makes him more annoying than endearing. Their scenes drag on for too long, making the already sluggish pacing even worse.

Outdated Animation and Overused Songs

Yes, the film was groundbreaking for its time, but by today's standards, the animation looks flat and lifeless. The backgrounds are decent, but the character movements feel stiff, and the facial expressions are sometimes unsettling. The songs? ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" is painfully outdated, and ""Heigh-Ho"" is catchy but gets old after the first five times you hear it.

The Villain Is the Only Good Part

If there's one saving grace, it's the Evil Queen. She's dramatic, stylish, and genuinely menacing. Her transformation into the old hag is one of the few memorable moments in the film. But even she is ultimately wasted-the way she dies (falling off a cliff) is as generic as it gets.

Final Verdict: Overrated and Dull

While Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs may have historical importance, that doesn't make it a good movie. With a boring protagonist, a paper-thin plot, and pacing that drags, it's one of Disney's weakest classics. Unless you're a die-hard Disney fan, you're better off watching literally any other animated film.",1.0,2025-03-31,3,0,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

Even iconic moments, like Whistle While You Work, are changed for no reason she doesn't even whistle, which makes the song lose its meaning. It feels like Disney is more focused on making statements than creating good films, and in doing so, they have lost touch with what made their classics special.

tt6208148,rw10417503,imdbfan-0970396546,A Fairytale Catastrophe - Disney's Worst Remake Yet,"If you thought Disney's live-action remakes couldn't get any worse, Snow White proves you wrong. This film is an absolute train wreck from start to finish, taking everything magical about the original and stomping it into oblivion.
Let's start with Rachel Zegler, whose performance as Snow White is about as enchanting as a wet piece of cardboard. She delivers every line with the enthusiasm of someone forced to be there, turning one of Disney's most iconic princesses into a bland, unlikable protagonist. Her acting is stiff, her expressions feel forced, and she lacks any of the grace or charm needed to carry such a legendary role. Rather than evoking the sweet innocence of Snow White, Zegler's portrayal comes off as disengaged and, at times, outright irritating.
The film itself is a visually dull, uninspired mess, with CGI so atrocious it makes Cats (2019) look like a masterpiece. The supporting cast does little to elevate the film, with chemistry so nonexistent you'd think they filmed their scenes separately in different dimensions. The dwarfs (or rather, the bizarrely reimagined ""band of misfits"") are forgettable at best and cringe-worthy at worst. The story has been rewritten into something unrecognizable, stripping away the heart and soul of the original in favor of a lifeless, preachy script.
It's clear that Disney had no love for the source material when making this movie. Instead of delivering a nostalgic, heartfelt reimagining, they gave us a lifeless cash grab that no one asked for. If you're looking for an enjoyable fairytale experience, do yourself a favor-watch literally anything else.

For audiences seeking the magic and wonder of the original, this remake regrettably fails to deliver. Commercially, Snow White has underperformed, reflecting its critical reception.

tt6208148,rw10392828,ogram-12137,Amazing Movie,"I loved the representation within the movie and the amazing visuals. The new Snow White movie, directed by Marc Webb and featuring Rachel Zegler as Snow White and Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen, is a breathtaking reimagining of the beloved classic that successfully intertwines nostalgia with modern storytelling. With stunning visuals, a powerful soundtrack, and a fresh take on character development, this film is a must-see for both fans of the original and newcomers alike.
From the very first scene, the film captivates audiences with its enchanting visuals. The cinematography is nothing short of spectacular, showcasing lush forests, vibrant colors, and intricate set designs that bring the fairy tale world to life. Each frame feels like a painting, drawing viewers into the magical realm where Snow White resides. The attention to detail in costume design also deserves praise, as it beautifully reflects the characters' personalities and the film's overall aesthetic.
Rachel Zegler delivers a remarkable performance as Snow White, embodying the character's innocence, strength, and determination. Unlike the traditional portrayal of Snow White as merely a damsel in distress, this version presents her as a proactive and resilient young woman who is not afraid to stand up for herself and fight against injustice. Zegler's vocal talents shine in several musical numbers, adding depth to her character and making her journey even more relatable. Her chemistry with the supporting cast, particularly the seven dwarfs, is heartwarming and adds a layer of camaraderie that enhances the overall narrative.
Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen is equally impressive. She brings a commanding presence to the role, effectively capturing the character's complexity. The film delves into the Queen's backstory, exploring her motivations and insecurities, which adds depth to her villainy. Gadot's performance is both fierce and vulnerable, making her a formidable antagonist while also eliciting sympathy from the audience. The dynamic between Snow White and the Evil Queen is central to the story, and their encounters are filled with tension and emotional weight.
The film's soundtrack is another standout feature, with original songs that perfectly complement the story. The music, composed by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, captures the essence of the characters and their journeys. Each song is intricately woven into the narrative, enhancing key moments and evoking a range of emotions. The musical numbers are choreographed beautifully, making them a joy to watch and listen to. The blend of classic fairy tale themes with contemporary musical styles creates a unique auditory experience that resonates with audiences of all ages.
One of the most significant aspects of this adaptation is its emphasis on themes of empowerment and self-discovery. The film encourages viewers to embrace their individuality and fight for what they believe in. Snow White's journey is not just about finding love but also about discovering her own strength and purpose. This modern twist on the story resonates strongly with today's audiences, making it relevant and inspiring.
While the film pays homage to the original animated classic, it also takes bold steps to innovate and challenge traditional narratives. The inclusion of diverse characters and perspectives adds richness to the story, allowing for a broader representation that reflects our world today. The seven dwarfs, portrayed by a talented ensemble cast, are given distinct personalities and backstories, making them more than just side characters. Their camaraderie with Snow White is heartwarming and adds layers to the film's narrative.
In terms of pacing, the film flows seamlessly, balancing moments of action, drama, and lightheartedness. The screenplay is well-crafted, with witty dialogue and poignant moments that keep the audience engaged throughout. The film's climax is thrilling and emotional, leaving viewers on the edge of their seats and ultimately delivering a satisfying conclusion.
Overall, the new Snow White movie is a triumph that successfully blends nostalgia with modern sensibilities. With its stunning visuals, powerful performances, and a compelling narrative, it stands out as a remarkable adaptation of a beloved fairy tale. This film is not just for children; it appeals to audiences of all ages, making it a cinematic experience worth sharing with family and friends. It's a refreshing reminder of the timelessness of fairy tales and the importance of courage, friendship, and self-empowerment. Without a doubt, this Snow White deserves a solid 10/10 for its artistic vision and heartfelt storytelling.",10.0,2025-03-21,95,1643,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0
tt6208148,rw10412876,imdbfan-4722516724,So terrible,"This movie was awful, absolutely awful. Terrible casting and actresses. The casting choices for Snow White were particularly disappointing, as they seemed more focused on star power than on finding actors who truly embodied the characters. The lead actress, while popular, lacked the charm and innocence that the role of Snow White requires. Instead of bringing the beloved character to life, her performance felt forced and unconvincing, leaving audiences disconnected from the story.
Moreover, the supporting cast did little to elevate the film. The dwarfs, who are essential to the original tale's charm, were portrayed in a way that felt more like caricatures than genuine characters. The casting of well-known actors in these roles did not translate into memorable performances; instead, it felt like a missed opportunity to showcase lesser-known talent who could have brought authenticity and depth to the characters.
The chemistry between the cast members was also lacking. In a fairy tale, the relationships between characters are crucial, and viewers need to feel a genuine connection. Unfortunately, the interactions between Snow White and the prince felt awkward and devoid of any real emotion. Their romance, which should have been a central theme, came across as rushed and superficial, making it hard for the audience to invest in their journey.
Additionally, the film attempted to introduce a more modern take on the story, but this approach only highlighted the shortcomings of the casting. The decision to cast actors who fit a particular mold rather than those who could authentically portray their roles resulted in a disjointed narrative. The film struggled to balance contemporary themes with the classic fairy tale elements, and the casting choices only exacerbated these issues.
The dialogue, too, suffered due to the poor casting decisions. The actors seemed unable to deliver the lines with the necessary conviction, making even the most poignant moments feel flat. The film's attempts at humor fell flat as well, as the comedic timing was off, largely due to the actors' inability to fully inhabit their roles. It's clear that casting is not just about finding familiar faces; it's about finding the right fit for the story being told.
In a film that relies heavily on its characters, the casting failures had a ripple effect on every aspect of the production. The audience's ability to suspend disbelief and immerse themselves in the story was severely hindered by the lackluster performances. Instead of being captivated by a magical world, viewers were left feeling like they were watching a poorly executed play.
Furthermore, the film's marketing heavily emphasized its star-studded cast, leading to heightened expectations that were ultimately not met. The promotional material suggested a film that would be both enchanting and entertaining, but the reality was far from that. The disconnect between the marketing and the actual performances only added to the disappointment.
Ultimately, the casting choices in Snow White were a significant factor in the film's failure to resonate with audiences. The misalignment between the actors and their characters created a barrier that prevented viewers from fully engaging with the story. It serves as a reminder that casting is a crucial element of filmmaking, one that can make or break a project. In this case, the poor casting decisions overshadowed any potential the film may have had, leaving audiences with a sense of regret for what could have been.
In conclusion, the new Snow White film is a prime example of how critical casting is to the success of a movie. The lack of suitable actors in key roles led to a disjointed narrative, weak character development, and an overall failure to capture the magic of the original tale. Viewers are left hoping that future adaptations will learn from these mistakes and prioritize casting choices that truly honor the beloved characters and stories they aim to portray.",1.0,2025-03-28,5,1,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

Snow White is a prime example of this-an absolute train wreck from start to finish. With a lifeless script, uninspired direction, and a shockingly bad lead performance, this film fails on every level.
The production quality is abysmal. Scenes are poorly lit, editing feels choppy, and the CGI (when used) looks like it belongs in a low-budget TV movie from the early 2000s.

tt6208148,rw10426470,RaeSerbeck,The Most Tone Deaf Adaptation I've Ever Unfortunately Seen,"Disney's latest live-action remake, Snow White (2025), is a film that should have been a celebration of both timeless fantasy and modern storytelling. However, what could have been a nostalgic yet refreshing adaptation quickly becomes a disjointed, tone-deaf experience-one that misses the mark on almost every level.
The film's visual design is perhaps the most glaring issue. Despite the usual Disney budget and high-end special effects, Snow White feels strangely hollow. A notable critique is Rachel Zegler's costume, which has been widely compared to Lord Farquaad from Shrek. The simplistic, almost cartoonish design of Snow White's dress fails to convey the elegance and magic expected from the character. While the film is visually ambitious, it often feels more like an over-polished set piece rather than a heartfelt retelling of a beloved classic.
Another major misstep lies in Disney's casting of the seven dwarfs. In an era where representation is crucial, the decision to cast non-disabled actors and then digitally alter their appearances through CGI is an unfortunate and outdated choice. This decision not only feels tone-deaf but also ignores the opportunity to cast actors with dwarfism, further distancing the film from its intended audience and reinforcing the perception that Disney is out of touch with modern sensibilities.
No review of Snow White would be complete without addressing the significant controversy surrounding lead actress Rachel Zegler. Her outspoken comments on the original 1937 animated Snow White, combined with her politically charged public persona, have taken center stage in the film's reception. Instead of focusing on the story or the performances, the film's promotion has been overshadowed by Zegler's remarks, and it's clear that her presence has become a lightning rod for much of the backlash. It's difficult to ignore the sense that her involvement in the project has become emblematic of the film's overall disconnect with audiences.
Perhaps the most damaging aspect of Snow White is Disney's apparent loss of connection with its core audience. The film attempts to blend the charm of the original with modern sensibilities but ends up alienating nearly everyone in the process. For fans of the 1937 classic, the film's heavy-handed updates feel unnecessary and out of place, while the younger, more progressive crowd that might appreciate its political leanings seems equally uninterested in what the film is trying to say. Ultimately, the film fails to recapture the warmth and wonder that made Disney's animated films legendary.
There is at-least one dim light amidst the film's many shortcomings: Gal Gadot. As the Evil Queen, Gadot gives a performance that is, frankly, far too good for the film she's in. She brings a subtle gravitas to the role, ""cardboard-ish"" at times, but her natural charisma makes her the most compelling character in the film. It's a shame that her talents are wasted on such a flawed project, as it's clear that Gadot's presence is the only thing keeping the film remotely engaging. Her portrayal of the Evil Queen is one of the few redeeming elements in what otherwise feels like a missed opportunity.
In the end, Snow White (2025) is a film that should have been a celebration of Disney's legacy but ultimately feels like a tone-deaf cash grab. From its mismanaged costume designs to its exclusionary casting choices, the film is a textbook example of how modern sensibilities can sometimes clash with the very essence of what makes a story timeless. Despite some bright spots-most notably Gal Gadot's stellar performance-the film struggles to deliver on any level. With an IMDb score of 1.5, it's hard to imagine Snow White being remembered fondly, especially when it seems so out of touch with both its origins and its audience.
While Disney may have hoped for a nostalgic reimagining, Snow White stands as a stark reminder that in today's world, nostalgia alone isn't enough to carry a film. It requires heart, understanding, and, most importantly, a connection to the audience that has supported Disney for decades. Unfortunately, this remake fails on all those fronts. It's a single dim star from me.

Her acting is wooden at best and downright obnoxious at worst; the only redeeming factor is her voice, though even that isn't nearly enough to justify suffering through her presence. It's baffling that anyone would cast Zegler opposite Gal Gadot and expect audiences to accept the absurd notion that she could somehow outshine Gadot's natural beauty and charisma.
The rest of the film fails just as spectacularly-flat storytelling, forgettable visuals, and dialogue so dull it's borderline sleep-inducing. Gadot genuinely deserved better material and certainly a co-star capable of matching her talent and allure. Instead, she had to navigate scenes opposite Zegler, who felt more like an arrogant, spoiled teenager demanding attention than a believable protagonist.

This cinematic crime against whimsy takes the classic story of Snow White and shoves it into a blender set to ""smug."" The result? A joyless reimagining that forgets to be fun, magical, or remotely coherent. The titular Snow White has all the charm of a tax audit, and the Evil Queen somehow manages to be less interesting than a Tumblr thread about toxic mirror culture.
The dwarves? Sorry-the not-dwarves. They've been replaced by a crew so generic you'd think they were procedurally generated NPCs. There's no chemistry, no warmth-just a lot of stiff dialogue and blank stares that make you wonder if the cast filmed this between naps.
The CGI looks like it was downloaded from a free asset store in 2012, the musical numbers are unironically worse than elevator music, and the pacing is so broken, I checked my watch more times than Snow checks her reflection.

She looks the part, sure-but the moment she opens her mouth, the illusion breaks. Her line delivery felt forced and flat, lacking any of the menace or nuance the role demands. Instead of being a chilling villain, she came off more like someone reading dramatic lines at a high school play rehearsal.
There was zero emotional depth, no charisma, and worst of all, no sense of danger. It's baffling how someone could turn such an iconic character into something so dull. The Evil Queen is supposed to be terrifying, regal, seductive-and Gadot was none of those things.

Rachel Zegler's lifeless Snow White and Gal Gadot's wooden Evil Queen lead a cast that stumbles through a cliché-ridden script, while the decision to replace the dwarfs with shoddily CGI'd ""magical creatures"" is both pandering and pathetic. The visuals are an eyesore-cheap sets, tacky costumes, and effects so bad they'd embarrass a low-budget video game-making this a film that looks like it was scraped together on a shoestring despite Disney's deep pockets.
The music is forgettable filler, the direction by Marc Webb is a masterclass in mediocrity, and the runtime feels like an eternity of boredom punctuated by preachy, muddled attempts at empowerment. This isn't just a bad movie-it's a betrayal of the 1937 classic, a soulless cash grab that leaves you angry you wasted your time.

The dwarves were comparable to that of early 2000s cosmetics mixed with a homemade movie made with AI from now.

Surprisingly Gal Gadot, who i always have been fond of, was not performing or delivering well at ALL. She was forcing it. But nowadays that's what these critics want so i wouldn't be surprised if she wins an Oscar for this, it's right up there with Wicked.

Let's start with the obvious: the heart and magic of the original are completely missing. Instead of a charming, timeless fairy tale, we get a watered-down, soulless attempt to modernize a story that didn't need fixing. Snow White herself is neither inspiring nor interesting, and the movie seems more focused on making a statement than telling a compelling story.
The dwarfs? Awkward, and add nothing to the film. The CGI is poor, the dialogue is painfully forced, and the humor? Nonexistent.
Then there's the villain, if you can even call her that. The Evil Queen, played by an actress who deserves far better material, is stripped of the menace and grandeur that made her iconic. Instead, she comes off as a generic, one-dimensional baddie without a hint of the elegance and terror we once knew.
The songs are forgettable, the pacing drags, and by the time the credits roll, you'll wonder why you wasted your time. Save your money.

It's clear this film has united viewers-not in awe, but in shared misery.
The plot, if you can call it that, stumbles along like a broken music box, creaking through a lifeless narrative that feels both rushed and bloated at the same time.
It's aimless direction and robbed story leaves you wondering why you're even watching. The dwarfs, now unsettling CGI monstrosities, drew ire for not using real actors-a choice so baffling it's been dubbed a ""creepy"" and ""off-putting"" disaster.
Meanwhile, the songs, a mix of old classics and cringe-inducing new additions, are slammed as ""unnecessary"" and ""embarrassing,"".
Rachel Zegler's Snow White is a lone bright spot, her vocal talent shining through the muck, but even her star power can't salvage this sinking ship. The Evil Queen, played by Gal Gadot, is described as ""unconvincing"" and ""stiff,"" lacking the menace needed to drive the story.
The visuals, hyped as enchanting, instead come off as ""artificial"" and ""tacky,"" a far cry from the fairy-tale wonder Disney once mastered.

First off, Snow White herself is one of the most annoying, helpless protagonists in film history.

If I had to listen to her sing one more time, I would have gladly eaten that poisoned apple myself.
The Seven Dwarfs? More like the Seven Gimmicks. Their only purpose is to be goofy caricatures with one-dimensional personalities. Dopey, in particular, is painfully unfunny, and Grumpy-ironically-is the only one I could relate to while suffering through this film.

This film embodies everything that's wrong with contemporary cinema's approach to classic adaptations. It's a complete disaster, and a profound disappointment.

Logic, zero. Everything felt out of place, with too much characters and too many relations that felt rush and didn't built well. The huntsman and SW's interaction is so horrible, how can a man give up his career for just an apple? The gnomes relation with SW felt weird too, but they're probably the least problematic ones.

This 1-hour-and-49-minute PG-rated disaster is so atrocious that I'm genuinely offended on behalf of anyone who had to sit through it. I've seen bad movies before, but this takes the cake, burns it, and then stomps on the ashes. If you're thinking about watching this, don't. Just don't. Save your time, your money, and your sanity.

The story-if you can even call it that-is a complete trainwreck. The original Snow White had charm, heart, and a simple but effective fairy-tale structure. This remake? It's a chaotic mess that feels like it was written by a toddler with a crayon and a grudge against happiness. The plot is a jumbled pile of nonsense, with random subplots that go nowhere and characters who make decisions so stupid I wanted to scream. Snow White is supposed to be a kind, resilient heroine, but here she's a whiny, insufferable brat who stumbles through the movie with the personality of a wet sock. The Evil Queen is somehow even worse-a cartoonish villain who's about as threatening as a paper bag. The dwarves? Don't even get me started. They're barely in the movie, and when they are, they're so bland I forgot their names five seconds after they were introduced. This isn't a story; it's a 109-minute insult to storytelling.

The acting is atrocious, and I'm not even sure I can blame the actors. The script is so garbage that even Oscar winners would look like amateurs trying to deliver these lines. Snow White's actress sounds like she's reading off a teleprompter while half-asleep, and the Evil Queen hams it up so hard I thought she was auditioning for a low-budget soap opera. Every line of dialogue is either painfully cliched or so out of place I couldn't believe it made it past the first draft. At one point, Snow White actually says, ""I'm not just a princess-I'm a vibe."" A vibe? Are you kidding me? Who wrote this? A middle schooler trying to sound cool on social media?

Visually, this movie is an eyesore. The CGI looks like it was done by a first-year animation student who forgot to submit their final project. The enchanted forest is a blurry, fake mess that looks like it was slapped together in a free app. The poisoned apple-supposedly a big, dramatic moment-looks like a plastic toy you'd find in a dollar store. The costumes are laughably bad; Snow White's dress is so cheap I'm pretty sure I saw loose threads flapping in the wind. And the songs? Oh, the songs. They're so terrible I wanted to rip my ears off. Every single one is a grating, auto-tuned mess with lyrics so lazy they sound like they were written by a malfunctioning AI. I'd rather listen to nails on a chalkboard than hear these tracks again.

This movie doesn't just fail-it fails spectacularly. It's a soulless, cynical cash grab that spits on the legacy of the original Snow White. It's clear the studio didn't care about making a good film; they just wanted to slap a familiar name on a poster and rake in the profits. Well, guess what? I'm not buying it, and neither should you.

A princess finds herself in a creepy forest and takes up residence with seven extremely loud and annoying housemates. The central conflict feels forced. The pacing is glacial, and the story struggles to maintain interest.
And let's talk about the romantic lead. He has the personality of a wet napkin. His grand romantic gesture? It's... certainly something. The animation, while groundbreaking for its time, is now dated and often unsettling. The songs are forgettable and repetitive, and the dialogue is clunky and exposition-heavy.
The supporting characters, intended for comic relief, are grating and one-dimensional. The antagonist's motivations are cartoonish and lack any real depth. The whole thing feels like a morality play hammered over your head with a sledgehammer. It's a classic, yes, but a classic that has not aged well. There are far better animated films out there, with more compelling characters, engaging stories, and less reliance on outdated tropes.

But we enjoy self hatred enough to watch the Twilight Saga on a semi-regular basis. We were excited. Would this be our new hate-watch movie... I have never seen my husband so bored. The man has a strong stomach, but 45 minutes in he was sneaking me notes of ""can we leave please"" , to which I responded ""let's wait 10 more minutes"". 2 minutes later the not-prince prince's musical number started. We left 2 minutes and 3 seconds later. The whole thing was a mess. They tried to preserve too much of the original cartoon, but mostly just stuff that doesn't translate to live action and almost a century later. My husband said Gal Gadot was the hardest part for him to watch, to which I blame the directing. They tried way too hard to also make it a Broadway play, but with glam.
Also, I love a good offensive joke. I typically will take one of each, please. But I would be so offended if I was a little person watching this movie. The dwarves were the worst part for me. Could they have made them look more like buffoons. How is it possible that 7 men have been alive for 274 years in the woods and not a single one knows how to whistle? These drwaves had more in common with those trolls or whatever in The Hobbit (who eat around the fire and turn to stone in the morning) than actual real life humans.

tt6208148,rw10418136,nipanderson,Being generous,"I felt like I wasted my money. Idk who wrote the script, but clever it was NOT. The dialogue was so wooden and uninspired that I often found myself zoning out, trying to figure out if the actors were actually delivering their lines seriously or just reading off cue cards with no enthusiasm. There was no wit, no charm, and certainly no memorable lines that could redeem this train wreck of a screenplay.
The costume design looked like a decent job from Joann's Fabrics, and that's putting it kindly. The fabrics seemed cheap and ill-fitting, with awkward seams and questionable color choices. Instead of looking like outfits that belonged in the film's supposed grand fantasy setting, they appeared more like last-minute cosplay attempts thrown together from the discount rack. The worst offender was the main character's supposedly ""royal"" attire, which looked like something that had been picked out of a high school theater's costume closet after years of wear and tear. Nothing about the wardrobe screamed grandeur, sophistication, or even basic craftsmanship. It was as if the designers had run out of money halfway through the production and decided to just wing it with whatever scraps they could find.
This really had the feel of a direct-to-video product. You know, the kind that skips theaters entirely and ends up in the bargain bin at a gas station within weeks? Everything about it screamed low-budget, from the poorly executed cinematography to the glaringly obvious green screen effects. Some scenes were so poorly lit that it was hard to tell what was happening, while others had a bizarre over-saturation that made it look like an early 2000s music video. The editing was choppy, with awkward cuts and pacing that made scenes drag on longer than necessary, further emphasizing just how amateurish the whole production felt.
And then there was the set design. My biggest gripe? The scene in the castle where the corners of the floor tiles looked as though they were curled-peeling. It was supposed to be marble! Instead, it looked like cheap laminate flooring that had been poorly installed. It completely shattered any illusion that this was a grand, imposing castle. Instead of feeling transported to another world, I was left wondering if the production team had simply borrowed a set from an old soap opera and hoped nobody would notice. The walls were flat, lifeless, and obviously fake, lacking any depth or detail. There was no sense of grandeur or scale, just a sad attempt at dressing up what was clearly a low-budget soundstage.
The acting, while not the absolute worst I've ever seen, was not great either. Some of the cast members seemed to be trying their best with the weak material they were given, but others delivered their lines with all the enthusiasm of someone reading a grocery list. There was no chemistry between the leads, making their supposed romance feel forced and unconvincing. The villain, who should have been menacing and captivating, instead came off as a caricature, with over-the-top delivery and zero depth. Not once did I feel invested in any of the characters or their struggles.
Money wasted on all sides. From the lackluster script to the uninspired set design, from the laughable costumes to the barely-there acting, there was not a single redeeming quality to this film. I walked in hoping for an entertaining experience, or at the very least, something visually interesting. Instead, I got a mess that felt rushed, careless, and ultimately forgettable. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this film to anyone unless they enjoy the kind of movie that's so bad it becomes unintentionally funny. Even then, there are far better options out there if you're in the mood for a so-bad-it's-good experience. This was just plain bad.

Rachel Zegler's performance lacks the warmth and wonder you'd expect from Snow White, and her dismissive attitude toward the original film in interviews only makes it harder to connect with her portrayal. The visuals, while polished, feel uninspired, and the replacement of the Seven Dwarfs with a mismatched group of CGI-enhanced characters just adds to the film's identity crisis.
Even my daughters, who usually love Disney films, wanted to leave halfway through. When a movie fails to captivate its target audience children it's clear something went very wrong.

Gone is the sweetness, innocence, and warmth of the original character-instead, we get a smug, joyless lead who spends most of the film looking bored or annoyed. Zegler delivers every line like she's above the material, as if she's embarrassed to be in a fairy tale at all. Her disdain for the source material is practically visible on screen, and it drains every scene of heart.
The film around her is no better. The iconic dwarfs have been awkwardly replaced by a random, mismatched group that looks like a casting experiment gone wrong.

The script is a mess of modern buzzwords and awkward moralizing, completely missing the timeless charm of the original.

Poor choice in casting.

tt0029583,rw10399010,Elvis-Del-Valle,"More than a remake, it is an acceptable adaptation of the work of the Grimm brothers","The film intended to adapt Snow White to more contemporary times, and it wasn't easy given that the animated film tells the story in a traditional way. There was no way to recreate it that would change this because the traditional style used is part of the animated film's identity. The choice was to be a loose adaptation of the Brothers Grimm tale, using elements from the animated film. The film has identifiable elements from the animated version, but a more distinct story that doesn't depend on the animated film. It's a much more independent story, but it maintains some very important aspects of the original tale.
Rachel stumbles at times, but her acting and singing are admirable. Because Snow White's name has always been linked to the character's appearance, redesigning the character wasn't going to be easy. Throughout the adaptations, the character has been fairly respected, with actresses who sometimes conformed to Snow White's beauty standard. Likewise, redesigning Snow White wasn't impossible, either her name or the meaning of her given name could have been changed. Here, they did the latter by linking Snow White's name to the time of her birth during the snowy season. In the 1997 adaptation, Snow White decided to summon courage and confront her stepmother. It was here that Snow White would evolve in subsequent adaptations, becoming a more heroic girl. In ""Mirror Mirror"" and ""Snow White & The Huntsman,"" we see this princess becoming a warrior to confront the queen and free her kingdom from tyranny. This 2024 adaptation follows the same formula, and unlike what audiences have said, here Snow White is driven by honor and concern for her people, just like in the adaptations exemplified above.
Something that has always been essential to the character's core is kindness and gentleness. This has been present in many of the different versions of Snow White, and her pure heart is what has always characterized her. This is also present in this film because Snow White cares for her people and the people around her. Here, Snow White resorts to more stoicism and is a force that acts more through the spirit than the body itself. Beyond giving new meaning to the name, the film does the same with the concept of beauty. When the mirror says that Snow White is the fairest, it doesn't refer to her look, but to the purity of her heart.
Gal Gadot plays Queen Grimhilde, who is serious most of the time and sometimes overacts, but maintains the character's characteristic jealousy and coldness. It may have left something to be desired, but it's a version that, in terms of design and personality, closely resembles the image Grimhilde has had since Disney's animated version. Although the film doesn't explicitly show it, it's easy to see that Grimhilde is overly obsessed with being the only beautiful woman in the entire kingdom. Something that has been present in many adaptations.
The seven dwarfs were redesigned as gnomes, partially respecting the look and personality of their animated counterparts. The downside is that the CGI gave them a somewhat bizarre appearance that could have been corrected with better rendering. Here, the prince was reimagined as a Robin Hood-style bandit named Jonathan. Although he is a somewhat careless man, he plays a role as Snow White's companion and future lover. Jonathan is a noble man who believes in justice and a rebel with ideas that are very compatible with Snow White's. The two make a good duo and have a chemistry that makes love blossom between them.
After all this, it's a very well-functioning adaptation and a stunning fantasy film. Regardless, the animated film remained difficult to dethrone, but this version of Snow White is a good and satisfying film. My final rating for this film is 9/10.",10.0,2025-03-24,10,128,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

While each piece is well-composed and performed, the overwhelming quantity dilutes their individual significance, leading to a sense of monotony rather than enhancing the storytelling. Instead of complementing the narrative, the songs at times feel like filler, detracting from the emotional weight and momentum of the film.
Furthermore, the movie deviates significantly from the essence of the original, to the point where it no longer feels like a faithful adaptation. While creative reinterpretations can be refreshing, this version strays too far, failing to capture the charm and timeless appeal of the beloved classic. Key elements that made the original story compelling are either altered beyond recognition or removed entirely, leaving behind a film that feels disconnected from its source material.
One of the most glaring issues is the portrayal of Snow White herself. She lacks the commanding presence expected of a main character, instead feeling more like a supporting role within her own story. The script and direction fail to give her the charisma, depth, or agency necessary to carry the film, making it difficult to invest in her journey. Rather than being an inspiring protagonist, she blends into the background, overshadowed by other elements of the movie.
Overall, while the film boasts strong production values and a promising soundtrack, its inability to honor the original story and its failure to establish Snow White as a compelling lead ultimately diminish its impact.

Snow had zero chemistry with the bandit, which made the true love thing feel rushed and weird. The song ""Princess Problems"" was tonally off.

Saw this on a test screening, and it was appallingly cliché and boring, with absolutely none of the magic and charm of the original. There's nothing at stake, nobody is particularly moving - it's just difficult to care.

We did stay, but only because we'd payed to be there. There was no one else in the theatre. I don't usually talk through a movie but I was so bored I was going to fall asleep if i didn't. We both agreed that it was the wrong casting, very live theatre performances, and the special effects/CGI were just terrible. I'm all for remaking a classic to fit the current time period but there are just some things that shouldn't be changed.

Would have been nice if they had created a more ""realistic"" magical set, like they did for maleficent or Cinderella (which I know was also a controversial film).

The flow of the film was entirely different than that of the classic. For instance in the classic snow first met her prince while at the well, not while he was stealing food.

Over all a change in casting, and putting some effort into the overall vision would've made for a more watchable movie. Otherwise change the costumes and some character names and you've basically got an entirely different film.",1.0,2025-04-03,4,3,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0

This was, without question, one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through. From the atrocious acting to the nonsensical plot, this was an absolute trainwreck from start to finish. I honestly feel like I lost IQ points just by watching it.
Let's start with the story-or rather, the lack of one. The plot is so paper-thin and riddled with inconsistencies that it's hard to believe anyone approved this script. It feels like the writers took a handful of clichés, threw them into a blender, and then haphazardly strung together whatever nonsense poured out. There's no character development, no logical progression, and certainly no payoff. The movie tries to introduce some kind of conflict, but it's so poorly executed that I genuinely didn't care about what was happening.
And speaking of characters, I have never seen a more unlikable, one-dimensional group of people in my life. The protagonist is painfully dull, lacking any personality or motivation beyond what the plot demands at any given moment. The supporting characters are even worse-either completely irrelevant or so cartoonishly over-the-top that they feel like bad parodies of actual human beings. The villain, if you can even call them that, is laughably incompetent. There was never any sense of danger, tension, or stakes because everything was so absurdly predictable.
Now, let's talk about the acting-or the absolute lack thereof. Every performance felt like it was given by someone who was either half-asleep or reading their lines off a teleprompter for the first time. The dialogue is so painfully bad that I honestly cringed at some of the exchanges. It's like the actors were actively trying to sabotage the film with their robotic delivery and complete lack of chemistry.
The special effects? Don't even get me started. It's hard to believe this movie was made in the modern era because the CGI looks like it was created on a decade-old computer by someone who just learned how to use animation software. Every explosion, creature, or action sequence is laughably fake, completely taking you out of the already abysmal experience. The editing is just as horrendous, with awkward cuts, jarring transitions, and scenes that drag on for far too long.
The soundtrack is equally uninspired. The score is either so generic that it sounds like stock music or so out of place that it feels like it was thrown in at random. At no point did the music enhance the mood or add to the atmosphere-it was just there, as forgettable as the rest of the film.
By the time the credits rolled, I was left sitting in stunned silence, not because I was impressed, but because I couldn't believe I had just wasted two hours of my life on something this terrible. If I had to sum up my experience in one word, it would be excruciating.
Do yourself a favor-avoid this movie at all costs. Watch literally anything else. Staring at a blank wall for two hours would be a more enjoyable and engaging experience.",1.0,2025-03-30,2,0,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0
tt6208148,rw10402288,parksiet,Disney magic!,"Snow White has that pure Disney magic, thanks to some incredible new music and a fantastic lead performance from Rachel Zegler! Waiting on a Wish was worth the price of admission alone! I had a smile on my face the whole time, it made the Disney adult in me very happy and worked very well as an adaptation of the original 1937 animated film. As someone who never really loved the original besides the appreciation of the history and the art behind it, I was way more into this version of the story! Not only that but unlike some other Disney live-action adaptations, this was a true adaptation of the story rather than pure nostalgic mimicry like The Lion King was! I liked the moments and songs that they kept, and I liked the changes they made! While not every choice in the movie works, director Marc Webb did a solid job bringing this fairytale to life with only a few missteps here and there. It can be clunky, and moments didn't always feel earned by the film especially when it came to emotion, but it still had that magical Disney feel to it. And it boasts some of the best new Disney music in years! Waiting on a Wish is spectacular, Good Things Grow is a perfect opening, Princess Problems is so fun, and A Hand Meets a Hand is gorgeous. The extensions/reworking of some of the classic songs like Heigh-Ho and Whistle While You Work were fantastic too and I was so happy to see those sequences come to life - it made me feel the same way I do when I go to Disneyland! The music was my favourite part for sure - songwriters Pasek and Paul did a fantastic job here! Another pro: Rachel Zegler was born to play a Disney princess! She is a naturally gifted performer, and she enchants as Snow White with her stunning singing voice and inherent charm. She is a star and one of the best parts and main reasons to see the film! Gal Gadot, on the other hand, is horribly miscast and one of the worst parts of the film, delivering a performance full of horrid line readings. I've come to expect little from these Disney remakes, but Snow White ended up being genuinely great! It's flawed, but it's one of the better remakes and I loved the changes they made while honouring what we love about the original - it is worth a watch for Disney fans!

tt6208148,rw10415250,imdbfan-7845415883,Awful 😭,"Do I even have to explain. Disney's live-action Snow White has faced relentless criticism for its misguided attempt to modernize a classic fairytale. From casting controversies to uninspired storytelling, the film has been widely dismissed as an unnecessary and poorly executed remake. One of the biggest complaints has been the portrayal of Snow White herself. While Rachel Zegler is a talented actress, many believe her performance lacks the warmth and charm that made the animated Snow White so beloved. Critics argue that her interpretation feels stiff and unengaging, making it difficult to connect with her character. This is made worse by the film's desperate attempt to rebrand Snow White as a strong, independent leader, stripping away the innocence and wonder that originally defined her. Instead of feeling like an empowering reimagining, the character comes off as forced, lacking the depth and emotional pull necessary for audiences to care about her journey.

Another major disappointment is Gal Gadot's Evil Queen, who should have been a highlight of the film. Instead, her performance feels awkward and unconvincing, failing to bring the menacing presence that made the original villain so iconic. Many critics have pointed out that her delivery is overly theatrical, making her more of a parody than a true antagonist. The lack of chemistry between Zegler and Gadot further weakens the central conflict, resulting in a dynamic that feels flat and uninspired. Without a compelling hero or a memorable villain, the story lacks tension and emotional weight, making the film feel like a hollow imitation of the original.

Visually, Snow White is another disaster. Instead of capturing the stunning artistry and whimsy of the 1937 film, this remake is filled with uninspired CGI and dull color grading. Many viewers have compared the visuals to a low-budget theme park attraction, completely devoid of the enchantment that made the original so timeless. The film's attempt to create a more ""realistic"" world results in a setting that feels lifeless and generic, missing the magic that should define a fairy tale. The CGI characters, particularly the seven dwarfs, have been met with ridicule, with many claiming they look like poorly rendered video game characters rather than beloved storybook figures.

Beyond aesthetics, the changes to the story have sparked widespread backlash. The film attempts to modernize the narrative by removing key elements that defined the original, including Snow White's traditional love story. While the idea of giving Snow White more agency could have been a positive change, the execution feels disjointed and unnatural. The filmmakers seem so focused on avoiding outdated tropes that they forget to provide a compelling alternative, resulting in a story that lacks emotional depth and a satisfying arc. Instead of feeling like a meaningful update, the changes come across as an unnecessary rejection of what made the original story so timeless.

The controversy surrounding the seven dwarfs further adds to the film's long list of issues. Early backlash erupted when actor Peter Dinklage criticized the traditional depiction of the dwarfs as outdated and offensive. In response, Disney reworked the characters, replacing them with a diverse group of ""magical creatures."" However, this change only fueled more criticism, with many arguing that it was a misguided attempt at political correctness that ultimately erased beloved characters. Instead of offering thoughtful representation, the decision felt like a reactionary move that failed to satisfy any audience.

Financially, Snow White has been a massive flop. With a reported budget of over $350 million, the film needed to be a box office success, but audiences have largely rejected it. Opening weekend numbers were shockingly low, and negative word-of-mouth has only hurt its chances of recovery. Many attribute this failure to Disney's overreliance on live-action remakes, which have begun to feel repetitive and creatively bankrupt. Audiences are growing tired of seeing beloved classics stripped of their charm in favor of bland, soulless reimaginings that add nothing of value.

Ultimately, Snow White stands as one of Disney's worst live-action remakes. From poor casting choices to uninspired visuals and misguided story changes, the film fails on nearly every level. Instead of recapturing the magic of the original, it alienates audiences by trying too hard to be modern while stripping away everything that made the story iconic. Rather than breathing new life into a classic, the film feels like an unnecessary and poorly executed attempt to cash in on nostalgia. As Disney continues to push out live-action adaptations, Snow White serves as a clear example of why some stories are better left untouched.",1.0,2025-03-29,2,0,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0
tt6208148,rw10424515,Jouford,Hmmm,"I make a point of never offering an opinion on any film or TV series until I've actually watched it. So, yesterday, I took my 9 year-old niece along to our local cinema in order to find out why this movie has such a low rating. After about 10 minutes, I got my answer.
Firstly, Gal Gadot cannot act. That certainly didn't help things. Whenever she was hamming it up on screen , I was reminded of an old teak sideboard my mother used to own. Her performance was dreadful. I kept hoping that Wonder Woman would put in an appearance, just to get things going.
Secondly, the animation was surreal, to say the least. The dwarfs in particular were very unnerving to watch. They were more Lovecraftian than they were Walt Disney. They were so unrealistic, they took me completely out of the movie whenever they were onscreen. The rest of the animation was confusing, and it was also incongruous in a Disney movie. It even freaked my niece out - and she's a massive Disney fan.
Thirdly, the lead actress was baffling. She can definitely sing, there's no disputing that. However, even after trying my utmost to separate the character from the person playing her, I just felt that her actual personality showed through. She's incredibly unpopular in the real world (rightfully so) and that seemed to have an effect on her portrayal of Snow White. But maybe I'm just biased.
The one positive about the experience is that the cinema was lovely and quiet. Apart from my niece and me, there were only 3 other people there.
To summarise: the movie is awful. I think it's done well to get 1 star, frankly. The re-shoots are jarring and obvious, the tone is completely off for a Disney production, the casting is dubious to say the least, and it suffers from the whole ""nobody asked for this"" conundrum.
As my niece so eloquently put it, ""What was the point in that? It spoiled the first film.""

tt6208148,rw10394787,Godfather0219,Disney's Snow White: A Soulless Remake with One Bright Spot,"Of all the Disney animated classics, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" might just be the least necessary one to remake. It's the most iconic, yet ironically, the one with the weakest emotional connection to modern audiences.
The original 1937 animated film is so old that most people either don't remember the actual plot or have never bothered to watch it at all. For most, ""Snow White"" lives on as vague cultural shorthand - a poisoned apple, a magic mirror, ""Hi Ho,"" and that's about it. Unlike the Disney Renaissance films (Aladdin, The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast), which still have songs people sing in the shower, ""Snow White's"" music barely registers anymore. It's a relic.
Another reason this remake felt unnecessary is Disney's self-imposed creative straitjacket. When Disney remakes ""Snow White"", they're not reimagining the classic fairy tale. They're remaking ""their own version"" of the story.
This gives Disney a competitive advantage but also creates a significant handicap. The advantage? Disney's animated ""Snow White"" is so culturally dominant that people often mistakenly think they invented the tale. This monopoly on the cultural memory of ""Snow White"" gives Disney an unparalleled level of brand loyalty - other studios can release ""their"" versions of ""Snow White"", but they'll just feel like ""yet another ""Snow White"" movie."" When Disney does it, it's ""The"" ""Snow White"" movie. It's an event. You don't want to ignore it.
The disadvantage? Disney can't stray too far from their original animated film. They ""have"" to keep the look and feel of their version intact to preserve their cultural dominance. Reinventing the wheel would risk alienating fans who expect the movie to ""feel like Disney."" So instead of daring, bold reimaginings like ""Snow White: A Tale of Terror"" (a horror take), ""Mirror Mirror"" (a campy comedy), or ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" (dark action fantasy), Disney gives us a watered-down rehash that feels as bland as it is redundant.
It's clear Disney believed that the only way to turn ""Snow White"" into another billion-dollar juggernaut was to stick to the formula. After all, it worked for ""The Lion King"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", and ""Aladdin"". Why mess with success? Those previous remakes were soulless cash grabs too, but they made money, so Disney stuck to the plan.
Unfortunately, they didn't anticipate that their one bold casting choice - the decision to feature a Latina actress as Snow White - would blow up so spectacularly in their faces.
Disney's live-action strategy relies heavily on nostalgia, but it's nostalgia dressed up in shiny packaging. The studio markets these movies as comforting throwbacks with just enough tweaks to feel ""fresh."" But in reality, these tweaks are often superficial, half-hearted, and inconsistent. ""Snow White"" is no exception.
The film is filled with Disney's usual sins: slavish devotion to the animated original (to the point of absurdity), awkward attempts to modernize certain aspects of the story, and an overall lack of creativity. The result is a movie that feels like it's trying to justify its own existence and failing miserably.
Take the visuals, for instance. Disney insists on preserving the look of the original film, but without any thought as to ""Why"" these design choices made sense in the first place. The costumes and set design feel less like ""classic fairy tale"" and more like ""theme park cosplay."" By comparison, ""Mirror Mirror's"" whimsical costumes fit the film's comedic tone, and ""Snow White and the Huntsman's"" gritty aesthetic matched its dark, action-packed vibe. Disney's live-action ""Snow White"", on the other hand, feels like it only exists to sell merchandise.
The story fares no better. Disney knows it needs to flesh out the characters and make their relationships more believable, but it never fully commits to these changes. For example, the Evil Queen's jealousy of Snow White is still mostly about beauty, with only a vague suggestion of political ambition. Meanwhile, the Huntsman's moral dilemma about killing Snow White is staged so awkwardly that it feels like a bad high school play. The actors do their best, but the scene is so stilted and out of place that it's almost painful to watch.
Perhaps the most glaring issue is the Evil Queen herself. Gal Gadot is, without question, the worst Evil Queen in cinematic history. And no, I'm not exaggerating. Let's be real: the only reason she was cast is because of her looks. Sure, she's gorgeous, but when you're following in the footsteps of Sigourney Weaver (Snow White: A Tale of Terror), Julia Roberts (Mirror Mirror), and Charlize Theron (Snow White and the Huntsman), looking pretty isn't enough. Those actresses brought elegance, menace, and depth to the role. Gadot? She brought... eyebrow wiggling and ""constipated villain face."" Every time she tried to emote, I felt secondhand embarrassment. Her singing? Let's just say it sounded so autotuned, I wasn't sure if it was even her voice.
To be fair, this is probably her least embarrassing performance since ""Wonder Woman 1984"". At least she managed to hit the basic beats of ""scheming and evil,"" even if it felt like she'd just learned the concept from an acting coach five minutes before filming. But honestly, Disney could've thrown a dart at a list of actresses, and anyone it hit would've been better than Gadot.
On the flip side, Rachel Zegler - the controversial choice for Snow White - is the film's one saving grace. Hate her all you want, but the girl can act, sing, and dance circles around anyone else in this movie. Her performance is effortlessly charismatic, with a radiant charm that lights up every scene she's in. You can criticize her all you want on Twitter, but her talent is undeniable. There's a reason industry legends like Rita Moreno have called her a ""triple threat"" - she's the real deal.
Zegler's musical numbers in this film are mesmerizing. She knows how to act through a song, weaving emotion into every note and gesture. Even her much-mocked expressions during ""Waiting on a Wish"" (yes, I've seen the memes) are a masterclass in theatricality. If you went into this movie determined to hate her, that's on you. But if you're willing to set aside the internet hate train for a moment, you might actually see why she's one of the most exciting young talents in Hollywood.
At the end of the day, Disney's live-action ""Snow White"" is exactly what you'd expect: a mediocre cash grab with a few fleeting moments of brilliance (courtesy of Zegler). It's not the worst thing Disney's ever made, but it's certainly not worth the hype. For me, it's just another soulless remake that exists more to sell toys than to tell a compelling story.

The acting was stiff, with performances so flat and lifeless that it seemed like the cast wasn't fully committed to their roles. The casting choices felt way off, and the lack of chemistry between the actors made even key moments feel forced and awkward. The dialogue was clunky, filled with cringe-worthy lines that did little to move the story forward. Meanwhile, the pacing dragged, making it feel like the movie overstayed its welcome.

Honestly, the only worthwhile part of the experience was the cool air conditioning in the theater, which provided more relief than the film ever did. It's hard to believe this was meant to be a major production because it lacked the magic, charm, and timeless appeal that a Snow White remake should deliver.

This version of Snow White strips away everything that made the original story magical and replaces it with a soulless, uninspired mess.
First, there's no prince-one of the most iconic elements of the story. Instead, the film feels like it's trying so hard to be different that it forgets why people loved Snow White in the first place. The heart, the romance, the fairy-tale wonder-completely gone.
Then there's the casting. Snow White, who is supposed to be ""the fairest of them all,"" doesn't embody that in any way, while the Evil Queen is stunningly beautiful but somehow doesn't believe she is. It's a bizarre contradiction that makes the entire premise fall apart.
The writing is painfully bad, the pacing drags, and the changes feel forced rather than organic. It's like the filmmakers had no respect for the original story or its audience. If you're a fan of the classic Snow White, do yourself a favor and skip this. It's a waste of time and an insult to a timeless fairy tale.",1.0,2025-03-27,3,2,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0
tt6208148,rw10423978,icejansantos,I'd give it zero if I could,"The cinematic travesty presented as a sequel, or perhaps more accurately, a desecration of the original, leaves one grappling with a profound sense of disappointment. To label the ""plotline"" as horrendous is an understatement; it resembles a haphazard collection of narrative fragments, devoid of coherence or logical progression. The film's attempts at dramatic tension fall flat, replaced by a sense of bewildered apathy. The writers seem to have abandoned any semblance of narrative structure, opting instead for a series of disjointed scenes that contribute nothing to the overall story.
The main character, a supposed protagonist, is an exercise in unlikability. The character's actions are consistently irrational and devoid of any redeeming qualities. The dialogue is stilted and unnatural, further alienating the audience. Any attempt to generate empathy is thwarted by the character's inherent flaws and the film's failure to provide any meaningful context for their behavior. The supporting cast fares no better, serving merely as cardboard cutouts, devoid of depth or complexity. Their interactions with the main character only amplify the latter's unpleasantness.
The film's visual presentation is equally underwhelming. The cinematography is pedestrian, lacking any sense of artistic vision. The special effects, when present, are amateurish and distracting. The musical score is generic and forgettable, failing to enhance the emotional impact of any scene. The editing is choppy and uneven especially the cgi, contributing to the overall sense of disjointedness.
In essence, this film represents a profound failure on multiple levels. It squanders any potential derived from the original source material, delivering a narrative that is both incoherent and unengaging. The characters are uniformly unlikable, and the technical aspects of the film are equally lackluster. It is a cinematic experience best avoided, a testament to the perils of creative bankruptcy. This production serves as a stark reminder of the importance of respecting the integrity of original works, and the dangers of prioritizing profit over artistic merit.",1.0,2025-04-01,3,2,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0

A tale of innocence tested by jealousy, purity overcoming corruption, and the idea that kindness and goodness will ultimately prevail.. changed into a film stripped away of its fairy-tale essence and the enchanting simplicity that charmed whoever saw it.

Whoever thought they could possibly improve upon Walt's timeless work of art? And with people and bad CGI of all things!
These visuals not only disappoints, but also hinders performances! As the actors struggle to react naturally to their surroundings, making the world feel even more artificial. The musical aspects are a mixed bag, with Zegler being a good performer, but unable to match Adriana Caselotti's magical notes and unfit for the character. Still, these few decent songs stand in stark contrast to Gal Gadot's seemingly digitized performance!
Then there's the matter of the many unnecessary additions, and an unearned love story. One that contradicts the actress's earlier statements about Snow White's independence.

When the queen asks who is the ""fairest"" and basically wins before she becomes second, it would technically mean that the evil wealthhoarding brutal queen is the fairest person until Snow White did help the guy. So technically, she was actually the best leader for the kingdom or what? Is everyone else even a worse human?

And then Snow White becomes the fairest, which is weird, weird anyways because she helped a single guy? Did that raise her social credit points so much?

It just feels rushed and incoherent because they seemingly changed it so often. Why do you have the rebels when they basically do nothing? What about the dwarfs? No one in the story is relevant.

tt6208148,rw10433946,imdbfan-3689416192,"Snow white, I wish it didn't exists","Story: the story was ok for the most part. It was a bit strange at first with a bit too many mentions of Snow White's father, who took a pretty big chunk of the main's character's motives. It's not about ""helping others"" or ""being the leader she know she can be"" as Rachel Zegler said, but ""meeting her father's expectations"" which I believe is not really a good thing. Snow white doesn't seem to be kind to.. be kind. She seem to be kind to ""impress his father"" like she mentioned in her song. I also thought that it would have been nice to have a little more sight of the townspeople suffering to really hammer in that the queen is not doing a good job at being a queen. I didn't enjoy that snow white was ""dead"" for so little time. It's strange said that way, but in the og version the dwarfs took care of her for a long time, which showed how much of a good impact she did on them.

Main character: Although I understand hat they were going for, I don't believe that snow white earned the interior beauty. In the movie, she didn't do anything to the townspeople after her father died, so I don't understand why, in the end, after years of disappearance, the townspeople would still trust her. She didn't really do many good action after she ended up in the forest: the animals instantly liked her when in the original they were first afraid. She also didn't do anything to gain the dwarfs trust besides dopey and it bother me. I get that they didn't want to make her ""clean and cook"", but in the end the dwarfs kept her because she was a princess, not because she helped around and was useful.

Dwarfs: Sadly, the dwarfs only scene were almost all cut. No bath scene, almost no fun shenanigans to like the dwarfs.. except dopey. Also, I want to mention that one of the dwarfs barely made a meaningful impact: the ones that shy. When I watched the movie with a friend, I listed off all of the dwarfs and my friend didn't even knew that he was there, which tells of the forgettableness of the dwarfs. I liked that dopey was given a bit more love, but I thought that it would have been better if they went more subtle: instead of making him talk in the end, that he was loved and accepted for who he is by his peers while still being dopey.

Villain: I thought that, although the evil queen was given more screenplay, she lost he natural calm creepy aura from the first movie. She didn't scream evil as much as the original.

Love interest: In the new movie, they replaced the prince with a thief. Although the idea doesn't bother me (they were able to make it with tangled pretty well.) it missed development. It would have been nice to know a bit more about his past life, maybe even some flashbacks to show why he became so ""all for one, none for all"". I also thought that him taking an arrow was strange, just because he and snow white didn't bond much in the movie. I didn't like that I knew nothing about his friends (except for the crossbow obsessed guy). The love interest felt overall forced and felt quite the opposite of what they were going for: in the original, yes, the prince didn't have much screenplay, but it was really impactful when he came to snow white's grave and kissed her as a form of respect and as a last goodbye. Here, he saved her life and now snow white is in love? It doesn't work

Other characters: I liked that they didn't fire the original ""7 magical creatures"" from the movie and made them have a little role. The only thing I thought was sad is that I don't know any of them. None of the, had the time to be presented besides the love interest and the one that loved crossbows (who I thought was kind of funny) I didn't like the small twist that they did with the hunter. In the original movie, he really brang a heart (and not an apple) which showed us that he was smart even in his small screen time. With the apple, I just thought that the queen was really negligent or her work

Conclusion: the overall message that the movie tried to achieve was lacking. It was more a ""tell don't show"" when it comes to Snow white's kindness, which we saw when she was a young child and when she saved a thief. The secondary characters missed a bit of life and car. The story was ok. The evil queen missed its spark and the love interest was just.. a bit forced.",3.0,2025-04-05,3,1,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

I've always loved the original Snow White because, at its core, it's a story about innocence, kindness, and the simple dream of finding love and belonging. Snow White was just 14 years old, a girl who wanted a quiet life, adored animals, and longed for acceptance, something I deeply related to during my teenage years. Her purity and gentle nature made her an endearing character, someone you wanted to protect and root for.
But this live-action SW completely strips away that essence. Instead of an innocent and kind-hearted girl, we get a smug and arrogant version of Snow White, far from the character who should represent youth, warmth, and sincerity.

tt6208148,rw10409566,imdbfan-5565414520,Worst movie of the year,"Disney's live-action remake of Snow White had a lot riding on it. With a massive budget, a classic story to pull from, and a star-studded cast including Rachel Zegler as Snow White and Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen, this should have been a sure win. But instead, what we got was a film that feels hollow, misguided, and, frankly, unnecessary.

The original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was Disney's first animated feature, a landmark in cinema history. It was simple yet charming, with iconic characters, stunning animation (for its time), and a fairytale feel that has endured for generations. This remake, however, doesn't seem to understand what made the original special.

For one, the film strips away key elements that defined Snow White. Gone is the traditional love story-replaced with a modernized version of the character that, while well-intentioned, feels forced and uninspired. Disney clearly wanted to make Snow White more ""empowered,"" but instead of adding depth to her character, they just removed what made her interesting in the first place. She's no longer a kind-hearted, naive girl who learns and grows-now she's just a generic heroine with little personality beyond vague independence.

The Evil Queen, played by Gal Gadot, is one of the few highlights of the film. Gadot gives a decent performance, but even she can't save a script that doesn't know what to do with her character. The iconic ""Mirror, Mirror"" scene feels lifeless, and while she has moments of fun with the role, she never reaches the campy menace of the original.

Visually, the movie is all over the place. Disney's recent live-action remakes have struggled with bland color palettes and excessive CGI, and Snow White is no different. The film lacks the warmth and charm of the animated version, replacing it with artificial, uninspired visuals. The seven dwarfs, one of the most beloved aspects of the original, have been turned into an odd mix of CGI and live-action that feels completely out of place. Instead of embracing the fantastical nature of the story, the film awkwardly tries to ground everything in reality, making it feel dull and lifeless.

The pacing is another major issue. Some scenes drag on far too long, while others feel rushed and abrupt. The climax, in particular, is a letdown, failing to deliver the emotional weight or excitement the story needs. The musical numbers, which should have been a highlight, are forgettable at best. None of the new songs add anything memorable, and the classic tunes from the original are either watered down or removed entirely.

Beyond its creative failures, the movie also suffers from behind-the-scenes controversy. Rachel Zegler's comments about the original film being ""outdated"" rubbed many fans the wrong way, and Disney's attempt to modernize the story feels like an overcorrection. Instead of respecting what made Snow White beloved, they tried to reinvent it in a way that alienates both old fans and new audiences.

At the box office, Snow White has struggled, barely making a dent compared to Disney's past live-action hits. With a production budget of over $270 million, the film needed a massive return to be profitable, but it has failed to gain traction. Audiences aren't interested, and word-of-mouth hasn't helped. The film's Rotten Tomatoes score sits at a disappointing 44%, and reviews have been lukewarm at best.

Overall, Snow White is yet another example of Disney's live-action remakes missing the mark. It lacks the heart, charm, and magic of the original, instead offering a bland, uninspired take that doesn't justify its own existence. While Gal Gadot gives it her best, and some of the cinematography has moments of beauty, the film ultimately falls flat. Disney keeps trying to remake its classics, but if Snow White is any indication, maybe it's time they stop.",1.0,2025-03-27,3,1,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

Yes live action remakes will never beat the original, but this is way better than previous live action remakes though Beauty and the Beast & the upcoming live action remake of Lilo & Stitch are exceptions.

Rachel Zegler really enjoyed herself as Snow White & she really brought the original Disney princess to life.

I don't care what others say. Gal Gadot was perfect as the Queen. As with Rachel, she too enjoyed her role. And she did a brilliant job as the original Disney movie baddie.

The songs were brilliant particularly Heigh Ho which was extended & introduced us to the seven dwarfs & Whistle While You Work which made Snow White like Mary Poppins. Really disappointed though they didn't include With a Smile and a Song. They should had that song inserted as it was one of the most iconic songs of the original film.

The one bit I loved the most was the forest scene as it was very well directed and I got goosebumps watching it. Bit disappointed we didn't see Snow White get confronted by log like crocodiles & especially the eyes watching her before she collapses to the floor.

Only main criticism I got was it was rushed & it could had went on for 120 minutes or so.

But I really loved this film.

People can criticise the film all they want as everyone has their opinion but my opinion is the film was fantastic.

The costumes also look like they have been grabbed for a Halloween shop and look so cheap. The colours are horrendous on Snows dress and the Evil Queens looks tacky with all the cheap looking beading on it.
They don't look anything like the original.
I've seen Rachel in the Hunger Games and her singing in that was amazing, but in this the songs were missing something from the orginal. They lacked the soul and voice of the original Snow White and sounded more pop music then classical Snow White.
The Evil Queen dialogue is also terrible. The actress doesn't even try to deliver the lines like she's confident. She sounds bored or tired and it takes away from the conversations.
Quite frankly this was Disney just trying to make a quick buck, but the public aren't silly.

However Snow White being my favourite Disney Princess I had to still go see it, and to my surprise it was actually a lot better than I thought. Some small parts of the story were altered, eg her being called Snow White due to being born during a winter storm (rather than skin as white as snow).

The hunter putting an apple in the heart box, rather than an animal heart. And her true love being a bandit rather than a Prince. But all of that were minor changes and the rest of the story line was quite accurate.

All though a lot was CGI (the backdrops and dwarves), the real life parts were wonderfully executed and beautiful. The village scenes with everyone dancing and singing were a favourite, particularly the last scene, the costumes were lovely.

It would've been great if the main character wasn't so opinionated about the film prior to its release, which I believe really hurt its appeal, but overall it was a well executed movie and they mostly stuck to the lovely, uplifting Snow White storyline that leaves you with a happy, nice feeling.",8.0,2025-03-28,3,23,2025-04-11 16:22:25,0

This is, without question, the most stunning, avant-garde, and powerful take on Snow White that Disney has EVER produced. I went in expecting a standard princess tale, but what I got was a deep, haunting, and visually poetic masterpiece.

First of all, setting Snow White in 1920s Spain? Genius. Pure, unfiltered genius. I never thought I needed Snow White as a bullfighter, but now I cannot imagine the character any other way. The silent film aesthetic? A BRILLIANT artistic choice. The expressive acting, the black-and-white cinematography, the flamenco-infused score-it all felt so raw, so real, so... authentic. Disney has truly outdone itself.

And can we talk about how they finally made the Evil Queen a complex, menacing, yet tragically human character? Every scene she was in felt like a gothic painting brought to life. And Snow White herself-her resilience, her passion, her refusal to be a passive damsel-just breathtaking. THIS is what we've been asking for! THIS is how you reimagine a classic!

And the dwarfs? Excuse me, the traveling circus troupe of misfits? Inspired. Absolutely inspired. Not only do they add depth to the story, but they provide some of the most emotional moments in the film.

I don't know why so many people are saying this is a disaster. What were they expecting? Another cookie-cutter CGI-laden remake? This is ART. This is CINEMA.

This isn't just a bad movie; it's a masterclass in how to ruin a classic, trample on its legacy, and insult audiences who just wanted a good story.
Let's start with the plot. The original fairy tale? Forget it. The magic? Completely erased. Instead, we get a painfully predictable and dull script that desperately tries to be ""modern"" but ends up feeling like a poorly written fanfiction. The moral messaging is so heavy-handed that even kids will roll their eyes.
The acting? Absolutely atrocious. The lead actress looks like she was forced into the role-zero emotion, zero charisma, zero effort to actually embody the character. The supporting cast? Either erased or replaced with such bland personalities that you'll forget they existed the moment you leave the theater.
Visuals and CGI? It's as if the budget was spent on anything but decent animation. The CGI is so awful it feels like a relic from the early 2000s. Even the natural environments look artificial, and the supposed ""magic"" is completely lifeless.

Snow White is supposed to win over the kids-and honestly, everyone watching-with real kindness, sweetness, and gentleness that leaps off the screen. That's the magic of the original. But here?

Instead, she's just... there, going through the motions like she's reading a script instead of living it. The kids deserve a hero who radiates that classic Snow White charm, and Zegler doesn't deliver.
The rest of the movie doesn't help either. Gal Gadot's Evil Queen is cold and forgettable, and the CGI dwarfs look like they stumbled out of a bad video game. The visuals are slick but soulless, and the story stumbles around without focus. But it's Snow White herself that sinks it.

I love the original film - Snow White is my favorite Princess. I appreciate the deep historical significance of the original + the history of film. It is what gave Disney his empire and this movie DOES NOT pay homage to that. Insulting & and a shame! Reverence should have been shown to the source material.

First and foremost...there are some major plot changes that are poorly articulated and written into the film. Enough changes that the essence + tone of the story was truly shifted. If you're walking in as a fan (like I was) you'll leave disappointed. This film is more like Tangled than Snow White to be honest. You have to approach this as a stand alone film - because it basically is. This is NOT Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Far from it.

The songs are catchy - and sound like every other musical inspired by Lin Manuel Miranda. Oh and this is very much a musical. That caught me off guard. Even the Queen gets an upbeat musical number! Eliminating classic songs like ""I'm Wishing"" & ""Someday my Prince will come"" was a miss. These new songs are catchy but not memorable.

Gal Gadot was horribly cast. And I'm a fan of hers! She's gorgeous and her costumes were breathtaking (honestly one of the highlights of the film for me), but her performance is terribly flat and unbelievable. Disney doesn't know how to write villains anymore! Giving her musical numbers really took away from her ""evil"" believability. Also the cause of her death? Unclear and confusing, like every other plot shift in this film.

Rachel isn't likable or believable as her character either - I imagine even IF you didn't know all the PR nightmare drama she'd spun prior to the release, you wouldn't love her as ""Snow White."" I still can't wrap my head around her casting. Why? I can list 5 other actresses off the top of my head who would have better fit the role & respected the honor placed on her shoulders. The only compliment I can pay to her is on her voice! She has some pipes, but ghat's about it. I'm convinced her voice is what's keeping her in Hollywood, because she simply cannot act.

The CGI Dwarves are unforgivable. Other than Dopey, they're FRIGHTENING & uncomfortable to look at. Their voices too are strange choices. There's nothing whimsical about them! Also avoiding utilizing actors with dwarfism to play lead roles for this film is insulting and truly a missed opportunity. What we got was garish. Their home/cottage however was my favorite part of the film! The only thing that truly pays homage to the cartoon. It was such a beautiful set piece! Holy cow! It was fun seeing their home come to life.

Other misfires:
Snow's hideous dress + haircut
overuse of CGI
oversaturated color palate
rewriting the ""prince's"" role
lack of romance (what we got was underdeveloped at best), overuse of tired ""girl boss"" motif
poorly written script + disjointed storytelling
lack of true Disney magic & putting out a film that feels soulless and generic.


Should you pay to see this film? NO. Wait to watch on Disney+ if you must. Fans of the real Snow White (like me) will be sorely disappointed. Such a shame!

The soul of the original is nowhere to be found, replaced with hollow messaging and lazy storytelling. Disney has clearly lost its creative compass, and this film is yet another misstep.

tt6208148,rw10405162,yashhraaj,"A Fairytale Reimagined, a Childhood Revisited","I watched Snow White (2025) at InOrbit's PVR Mx4D, and the experience was nothing short of transportive. The moment the story began to unfold, it wasn't just a cinematic journey-it was an emotional return to my first-grade days at Holy Name High School, Colaba, where fairy tales felt as real as the sea breeze outside our classroom windows.
Directed by Marc Webb and written by Erin Cressida Wilson, Greta Gerwig, and Dorothy Ann Blank, this live-action Disney adaptation stars Rachel Zegler as Snow White, Gal Gadot as the sinister yet mesmerizing Evil Queen, and Andrew Burnap in a supporting role. The film gives the 1937 animated classic a fresh, musical spin-with a Latina Snow White leading the way through a forest of magic, menace, and self-discovery.
Interestingly, as I watched the film in full Mx4D immersion, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was watching a fusion of three classic fairy tales: Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and Little Red Riding Hood. Perhaps it was the enchanted slumber, the dark and mysterious forest, or the deceptive appearances of danger wrapped in beauty-it all felt like a richly woven fairy-tale tapestry, where the innocence of youth meets the lurking shadows of fear and fate.
The visual effects were enchanting, the Mx4D effects-from the whooshing forest winds to the jolts of surprise-made every magical moment feel tangible. The performances were sincere, with Zegler bringing a quiet strength to Snow White, and Gal Gadot channeling icy elegance as the Evil Queen.
Though the film is tracking a modest box office opening ($45-55 million), it shines as a heartfelt reimagining that brings Disney's classic to a new generation-with fresh faces, diverse voices, and a modern undercurrent of empowerment.
In the end, it wasn't just a fantasy on screen-it was a mirror into the fairy tales that shaped our childhood imaginations, now retold with emotional depth and dazzling artistry.
Rating: 4/5
A magical, memory-laced journey that blends beloved fairy-tale traditions into a vibrant, emotional adventure. Best enjoyed with wonder-and in Mx4D, if you can!",8.0,2025-03-26,5,51,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0

Some Good Emotional Moments

Solid Messages.
Summary:
Despite the masses calling for the head of Snow White, I found a few things I think were done well in this film. We start with the voice acting and the cast that brings it to life when it comes to the dwarves and the magic mirror. Though not as strong as the original seven, I liked the new group very much and found their techniques quite fitting for the live-action make. They embody the personalities well and add that fantasy element Disney is very efficient at making but still holds more emotion than much of the non-digital cast. These guys are the ones who deliver some of the better dialogue, a few of the live-action cast managed to drop some really powerful lines at just the right moment that will make it on the quote boards. I found those quotes often in those very heartfelt moments where everything came together, some inflections of the Disney magic sparkling the way they did in the 1900s and delivering those solid messages of kindness, fairness, and hard work to solve problems.
Where most of the splendor came for me in the movie is the visual effects that capture that Disney cuddliness we know the company for holding. The costumes and makeup are solid rebuilds of the cartoon design, many of them authentic nods to the times but pop with a bit of modern sheen for future cosplays. Sure, some of the costumes look a little cheaper than others, but overall, it is a better portrayal of the character than other facets. I enjoyed the songs to some degree, with a very Broadway musical ambiance radiating from them as Snow sings her way through the opening numbers and dances about with the town in new songs that Disney continues to spin out. The older numbers are very fun as well, not quite as Mystical Melody as in the past, but still holding that fun charm that I remember from the film, but could have used some more finesse and planning to be memorable. Finally, the animation for the animals was something I found to be my favorite aspect of this movie. Like Enchanted, Snow White's live adaptation puts a lot of gorgeous detail into the animals, keeping much of their physiology with just a touch of the human element to add that adorable energy to give them their own tertiary personalities. They play a rather large part in the movie, and it helps add Disney family-friendly charm for the younger audience members that modern Disney continues to keep in their films and should be enjoyable to the masses.

Summary:
That's where the likes end, unfortunately. Snow White's live remake comes with several dislikes that I feel are going to be ill-received by audiences, given what I saw. One of the biggest weaknesses for me was the new plot. Sure, the origin of her name is a bit eye-rolling, but Snow White's new tale is trying to be too many things at once and do too many arcs in a compressed time. Snow White's desire to get outside the castle is not such a simple tale as we are introduced to bandits, dwarves, more of huntsmen, evil queens, and new desires for the protagonist. The film is loaded with way too many characters, and I don't really have time to learn most of their names or stories before jumping back into another facet of this movie. The writers struggled to pick lanes and stay in them, and their plot intertwining is very messy and knotted up with frayed transitions. I found it difficult to get tied to any of the characters, none of them packing that same punch outside a few moments nor as well-layered as I know Disney can do. Even the Wicked Queen is very wasted, an antagonist with such potential drowned out by awkward plots and too many arcs competing for dominance. Yet, the worst thing is Snow White's character is too spread thin between the different ""princesses"" she has to be. This new age of remaking the character but keeping to the classic got out of hand, Zegler doing her best to play so many approaches not enough to make this a very inconsistent Snow White I didn't love or hate. When you see that a lot of the live-character actors didn't have the best acting consistency, it only further weakens the strained characters for viewers like me and makes the film boring.
Surely, the spectacle is enough to make up for it, right? I'm sorry to say the answer is no on that one. The dance numbers are charming at times, that musical prowess present in the resonating voices, thundering instruments, and grandiose extensions of notes. However, many of the songs feel very much the same, with reprises and similar-sounding tunes that lack the variety I know Disney to have past their earlier works. The dance numbers also felt very carbon-copy, the same twirls, exchanges, and steps feeling lazy and repetitive shots that pale in comparison to shows like Wicked do so well. Even worse, the movie felt very carefree, where they inserted songs, with many of them feeling shoehorned in to get another track on the playlist. Such haphazard planning doesn't do much for me, especially when each track feels very much the same song. As for the action, this is another Snow White tale that struggles to do much with the action scenes or climatic struggles. This remake makes a show for building up drama, adding suspense with potentially losing characters at any moment before changing their mind. It's a rather safe film, with more marching and shadow work than actual action, making this feel like the second season of House of Dragons. While this is good news for parents who think any conflict is too violent, for those who like more meat to their story, you'll be subjected to some of the most anticlimactic resolutions to the story. A great theme to stick with regarding the messages, but as a spectacle, it is kind of dull in the grand scheme of Disney movies. All of these problems, I think, are due to the media coverage and the edits that came from it taking the changes too far to make a cohesive film.
The VERDICT:
I can see the potential of Snow White and some of the modern elements that could have worked. Disney continues to make good visuals and world-crafting tricks, supplies Broadway-like bellows in their tracks, good voice acting for some lines, and plenty of the new cute and cuddly magic that Disney has played well with their stories. That component will make this movie enjoyable for many families to see, especially those with younger children. However, in terms of a cohesive piece, this live-action fails on many levels with its approach to trying too many things in one film. The conflicting nature of Snow White between classic and new was not fun, nor was trying to juggle many characters who weren't necessary and could have spent more time with the dwarves. Much of the acting could do little to save bland characters who had little time to enjoy, and I was bored with the predictable and anticlimactic tales that couldn't get away from the messages. Throw in repetitive song and dance numbers, and you leave me little of that fantastic factor Disney's 2-D animation was known for having. Thus, is this movie a necessity for theater viewing? I don't think it is outside of a field trip or group outing, with your time much better spent watching at home. When I factor in everything, I give Snow White:

tt6208148,rw10408314,jnqtjfhy,Lost the magic of the original,"I recently attended a screening of Disneys live-action remake of Snow White 2025 and unfortunately found it to be a disappointing experience. Rachel Zegler, known for her role in West Side Story, portrays Snow White. Her performance lacked the depth and charm that made the original character so beloved. Gal Gadot, famous for Wonder Woman, takes on the role of the Evil Queen. While she brings a certain presence to the screen, her portrayal felt more glamorous than menacing, diminishing the characters iconic villainy.
Andrew Burnap plays Jonathan, a new character introduced as Snow Whites love interest. His addition to the story felt unnecessary and did little to enhance the plot. The Seven Dwarfs, voiced by actors such as Jeremy Swift Doc and Andrew Barth Feldman Dopey, lacked the distinct personalities that made them memorable in the original film.
The musical numbers, a crucial element of any Disney film, were underwhelming. Zeglers singing, despite her musical background, failed to capture the magic and emotion of the original songs. The new compositions by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, known for their work on La La Land, felt out of place and did not resonate.
Visually, the film is a mixed bag. While some scenes are beautifully shot, the overuse of CGI, especially in depicting the dwarfs, detracts from the overall experience.

And, I love Disney's Villain songs so much, and in this version, the Evil Queen has her own song.

Throughout the movie, there's no part that shows Snow White as gentle or compassionate. She's almost always ready to confront the Evil Queen. And towards the end, with the newly added scenes, it doesn't feel like Snow White needed any special skills to regain the throne. Isn't it too easy to just say her name and have the people remember how happy they were before? Why didn't she mention her name when she was locked in the castle or when she was tricked into the forest to be killed? And is the Queen defeated by kindness?

The CGI looked awful too. The ""dwarfs"" or whatever they are now felt so outta place and looked like bad photoshop half the time. Nothing felt real, it was all just green screen vibes and fake looking sets.
Gal Gadot tried I guess, but the script gave her nothing to work with. Every scene she was in felt pointless. The music was forgettable, the dialogue was cringey, and there's literally no emotion in any of it.

I fully support the creation of new stories with diverse characters and fresh narratives that reflect modern perspectives.

As someone who grew up with Snow White, this film is ingrained in my core memories, just as it is for those before and after me. Classics like these should be preserved and cherished, as they reflect the artistic and cultural values of their time.
While inclusivity and fresh perspectives in storytelling are important, significant alterations to such an iconic film risk diluting its original essence. A balance should be found-one that allows for new narratives to flourish without rewriting the legacy of timeless classics.

The dwarves, often the comedic relief in adaptations, are represented using CGI, which, while not as jarring as expected, still feels somewhat out of place.

Unfortunately, this version strays so far from the original that it feels like a completely different story-one that lacks the heart, charm, and timeless magic that made the animated classic so special.
The Main Character: A Major Letdown
The biggest flaw in this adaptation is Snow White herself. In the original, she is kind, gentle, and full of hope-traits that define her strength. However, in this version, she is completely unrecognizable. Instead of embodying the grace and optimism that made her a beloved character, she comes across as overly rebellious, dismissive, and even unlikable at times. Her attitude feels forced, as if the movie is trying too hard to make her a modern heroine while completely missing what made her special in the first place.
A Story That Loses Its Magic
The original Snow White is a story about innocence, kindness, and the triumph of good over evil. This adaptation, however, strips away the fairy tale charm, replacing it with unnecessary changes that add little to the story. The dwarfs, the prince, and even the Evil Queen lack the depth and presence they had in the original. Instead of enhancing the story, the film seems determined to ""fix"" things that were never broken, resulting in a version that feels hollow and disconnected from its source material.
A Disservice to Childhood Memories
For those who grew up loving Snow White, this adaptation is nothing short of disappointing. It takes a classic tale and twists it into something that barely resembles the story we all cherished. Instead of celebrating the original's timeless themes, it undermines them, leaving behind a movie that fails to capture the magic, warmth, and wonder of the classic fairy tale.
Final Verdict: 2/10
This live-action Snow White is a perfect example of why some stories are best left untouched. Instead of reimagining the tale with love and respect, it distances itself from everything that made the original so enchanting. If you're looking for nostalgia and fairy tale magic, it's better to revisit the 1937 classic rather than waste time on this disappointing remake.",1.0,2025-03-26,1,0,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0

Rachel is not a great actor and it really shows in this movie, the modern changes made to the film removed what people wanted to see.
With a budget of 300 Million Dollars, it beggars belief that Dsiney would allow this film to be made so poorly.
The only thing we enjoyed in the film was Gal Gadot's performance but we felt she was too pretty to portray an evil witch.

tt6208148,rw10426587,verrucktcarlos,This just isn't Snow White.,"Snow white has always been my favorite Disney film. I was obsessed with it as a kid. No matter how many times I watched it, I never got tired of it, and it never ceased to fascinate me. I knew all the songs, the dialogues and I even begged my mom to buy me a Snow White doll when I was around 6.

The animated film has always had a very special place in my heart.

I'm not going to say that this live action remake fails to capture the essence of the original movie, because saying that would imply that there was at least an intent to do so. This was purposefully stripped of all the things that make Snow White such a beautiful timeless classic.

The 1937 film was a success because it was 100% committed to the fact that it was a fairytale. It's magical, hopeful, scary when it needs to be, and overall, extremely emotional and tender.

This live action on the other hand, is totally ashamed of the fact that it is a fairytale, and they let you know that all throughout. Snow white here is anything but selfless and she doesn't even care about the dwarves. She's completely devoid of tenderness, innocence and sweetness.

Originally, she tidies up the dwarves' cottage because she believes it is orphans that live there. And she hopes that they will let her stay if she helps them cleaning and cooking. She wants to give them a nice surprise when they get home.

In this remake, she literally just walks in the cottage, goes up to the bedroom and falls asleep. Then, when she meets the dwarves, she doesn't even beg them so she can stay. She literally just wants to leave, and the only reason she stays is because it starts raining. And still, she leaves the next day.

The relationship with the dwarves is just not developed at all. She is supposed to be a motherly figure to them, she wants to earn their trust and their love. In the original, she even prays at one point, asking God to bless the little men that have been so kind to her.

She doesn't make the pie for Grumpy, she doesn't kiss the dwarves on the forehead. Omitting all these things just results in characters that you feel nothing for.

The animated movie is about 30 minutes shorter than this one. And regardless, you feel a lot more emotionally invested in the animated version.

And I haven't even mentioned the music. One of the biggest offenders. They left out not only almost all of the songs, but the soundtrack as a whole that is absolutely fantastic.

The epic music from the opening credits which is an instrumental of ''One song'' is gone. All of the renditions of ''One song'' are gone because there's no way they were gonna have a man serenading a woman.

The epic orchestration in the forest scene, the eerie music that plays when the Queen transforms herself, Someday my prince will come, The silly song (they give like a 10 second nod to this one) all of that just gone and replaced with extremely generic modern day Broadway type of music.

And, something that it is not often mentioned, is that Snow White has one of the most truthful and heartfelt depictions of mourning ever put on a film. The scene where the dwarves are mourning her in the cottage can make a grown man cry. You will not cry during this remake of course. The dwarves don't even build a coffin for Snow White, they just lay her on a stone.

How can an 80-minute animated film move your soul to the point of crying? Snow white is about love as much as it is about death. The film even ends with a castle in the sky, giving way to many different and interesting interpretations.

The original movie is just an emotional journey. It is delicate, tender, funny, magical and overall, wholesome and beautifully heart-warming. This remake doesn't even have a hint of those things.

Rachel Zegler's and Gal Gadot's extremely lackluster acting is only one of the many problems with this film

They shortened and discarded so many key elements from the original, in order to include music, themes and characters that have absolutely nothing to do with the 1937 masterpiece.",1.0,2025-04-02,2,1,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0
tt6208148,rw10413793,TapchantRandom,Underrated,"Snow White (2025) is a deeply emotional and breathtaking reimagining of the classic fairy tale that will leave you wiping away tears. This movie is not just a fairy tale; it's a rich, emotional journey about growth, loss, and self-discovery. Honestly, I wasn't prepared for how hard it would hit me, and by the end, I needed a box of tissues.
Positives:
Rachel Zegler shines as Snow White. She brings a modern, empowering take on the character, making her more than just a damsel in distress. Snow White is strong, relatable, and fully in control of her own destiny. Zegler captures both the innocence and the power of Snow White's journey, making her transformation feel real and heartfelt.
Gal Gadot's portrayal of Maleficent is truly stunning. While Maleficent is traditionally the villain, this version adds layers of depth to her character. Gadot's Maleficent is not just evil for the sake of it-she's a woman broken by betrayal and pain. There are moments when you can't help but sympathize with her, even though her actions are cruel. The final confrontation with Maleficent is emotional and earned, and while it's clear she deserves to be defeated, you still feel the weight of her loss. Gadot's performance brings a unique complexity to the character, making her defeat both satisfying and bittersweet.
One of the most charming parts of the film is the cuteness overdose with the animals. From Snow White's connection with the birds and squirrels to the delightful creatures that help her along the way, these adorable moments add so much warmth to the film. They also help showcase Snow White's kindness and purity. If you love animals in fairy tales, you'll absolutely fall in love with these moments, though at times the cuteness factor might make your heart explode!
Negatives:
The pacing slows down a little in the middle of the film, especially in the quieter moments. While these moments do add emotional depth, they can feel a bit drawn out for some viewers. However, this is a minor issue in an otherwise well-paced film that does a great job of building emotional tension.
Conclusion:
Snow White (2025) is a modern fairy tale that feels fresh, emotional, and deeply relatable. The performances, especially by Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot, are top-notch. Gadot's Maleficent is a standout complicated, tragic, and unforgettable. The cuteness of the animal companions adds a light, heartwarming touch, though sometimes it may feel like a little too much. However, it's all part of the charm.
The film's ending, while sad, is perfect for the story it tells: a bittersweet reminder that sometimes, to follow our dreams, we have to let go of things we love. Snow White's journey isn't just about defeating Maleficent-it's about finding her own strength and embracing who she truly is. It's a stunning, emotional experience that leaves you with a sense of fulfillment, but also a little bit of sorrow.",10.0,2025-03-28,24,408,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0

Everything Sigourney brought to the role is so much more robust than Gal Gadot. This is less to do, likely, with Gadot as an actress and more to do with the slipshod team behind the movie. Though Gadot's performance is certainly not memorable.

First off, the charm and heart of the original story were nowhere to be found. The dwarfs? Gone or reimagined in a way that made you miss the classics.

The visuals were decent, but all the gloss in the world can't save a flat story with awkward dialogue and a total lack of emotional pull. The script tried to modernize the tale but ended up watering it down into something so generic it could've been AI-generated.

Overall, I'd give Snow White 3.0 out of 10 stars. While Zegler's performance was a highlight, the rest of the movie was a bit of a mess. If you're a die-hard Disney fan, you might enjoy it, but otherwise, it's a skippable remake.

Snow White was one of the core fairytales from my childhood and I still hold it dear. Despite that I couldnt watch it till the end. The only good actor was Gal Gadot and that was not enough for me.
As for Snow White, I couldnt symphatyze with her for the first time in all adaptations. I just really dont like this actress. One part may be her vibe that I dont like, the other thing may be her apearance. She just doesnt look like a Snow White to me. If the roles were reversed with Gal, I think it would be better.

I really think I'd prefer the sounds of a baby crying in the theater. At least then I'd feel some emotion. The theater might as well been filled with zombies with how dead the audience was.
Didn't hear a single chuckle, or really any reactions. The second the dwarfs showed up on screen a toddler in the row in front of me began to bawl. Pretty accurate to how the rest of the movie went.

The latest adaptation of Snow White is nothing short of a disaster. It takes a beloved classic and strips it of its charm, replacing it with a dull, uninspired storyline and unconvincing performances.
One of the biggest letdowns is the protagonist herself. Instead of embodying the warmth and innocence that made Snow White so iconic, the lead character feels forced and unrelatable. The changes to the original story feel unnecessary and even counterproductive, making it difficult to connect with the film.
The visuals, though attempting to be grand, come across as artificial and lifeless. The CGI feels excessive and at times poorly executed, taking away any sense of realism or magic. The supporting characters, who should add depth and humor to the film, are bland and forgettable.
The pacing is another major issue. The film drags in places where it should be exciting and rushes through moments that should be meaningful. The lack of emotional weight makes it hard to care about what's happening on screen.
Overall, Snow White is a disappointing attempt at reimagining a classic. It lacks heart, depth, and the magic that made the original so timeless. If you're a fan of the classic fairy tale, you're better off skipping this one.",1.0,2025-03-31,1,0,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0

Another problem was that the CGI for the animals felt too cartoony, and I honestly wasn't a big fan of it. And the casting wasn't that great, the elves and queen were well casted and were perfect! But the actress for Snow White was bad, she didn't really look like the original... for me at least. I'm not saying she shouldn't act again, I'm just saying that she wasn't the right one for Snow White. Another thing I should clarify is that I know that the film isn't for me, it's for the younger audience. But a film for kids should also be for the adults/family.
In conclusion, the film failed to live expectations, mediocre acting, and bland story. 4.5/10.",4.0,2025-03-23,4,6,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0

Gal Gadot was a serious miscast, there is nothing of hers that feels in place here. She's hidden under this costume and she can't sing and still they gave her a lot to do. The whole movie suffers from a really badly written script. There are many ideas that they could have built more on, but sadly they chose to explore many, without really giving any of them the space to develope into something fresh or bold or beautiful. I didn't expect this to be a musical, most of the modern songs were really cringe worthy and felt like they don't belong in this world of ""Snow White"". The seven dwarfs honestly are an outrage, I really won't ever understand how this felt acceptable. Sadly there are many things that kill the joy in the movie, and the serious problem is the pacing and the plot that's all over the place.

Not at all. While the film isn't a groundbreaking masterpiece, it's far from the disaster some have made it out to be.
Rachel Zegler delivers a solid performance as Snow White, with her acting bringing a fresh, independent take on the classic character. Her singing, as expected, is lovely-her voice is one of the highlights of the movie. While her version of Snow White may not appeal to everyone, she carries the role well.
Visually, the film is a mix of stunning set pieces and some questionable CGI moments, which is a common issue in many modern Disney films. The story has been updated, and while some changes might feel unnecessary, they don't ruin the movie. It still carries the heart of the original tale, just with a more modern sensibility.

Rachel Zegler is not at all convincing as Snow White; she lacks the charm, innocence, and grace that made the original character so beloved. Her performance feels out of place, and she doesn't capture the magic that the role demands. The only saving grace of the film is Gal Gadot, whose screen presence is undeniably captivating. She brings a certain elegance and charisma that stands out amid the otherwise messy storytelling. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is all over the place, with an incoherent plot, uneven pacing, and a distorted vision that strays too far from the beloved fairy tale.

The Evil Queen is supposed to be the embodiment of vanity, cruelty, and obsession. She's a character whose sinister presence looms over Snow White, creating tension and fear. Unfortunately, Gadot's version of the character never achieves this. Instead of exuding menace, she comes across as campy and cartoonish. Her exaggerated facial expressions, especially her constant eyebrow-raising, make it difficult to take her seriously. At times, she seems more like a comedic villain from a children's TV show than a dark, calculating sorceress.
A major issue with Gadot's performance is that she lacks the gravitas required for the role. She doesn't have the vocal authority to deliver lines with the weight they deserve. When she speaks, her lines sound unnatural and forced, as if she's reading them from a teleprompter rather than embodying the Queen's sinister essence.

tt6208148,rw10409302,binupadisarathna,Awful,"Snow White (2025) is, without question, a visual spectacle and a thoughtful reimagining of Disney's first animated masterpiece. The film boasts stunning production design, a carefully crafted atmosphere, and a supporting cast that brings fresh life to this classic tale. Unfortunately, what could have been a near-perfect remake is held back by its most crucial element - Snow White herself.
Let's start with what the movie gets right, because there is a lot to admire. The world of Snow White (2025) is nothing short of breathtaking. The enchanted forest, the Queen's dark castle, and the whimsical cottage of the dwarfs are all realized with an incredible attention to detail. The art direction balances fairy tale charm with a slightly darker, mature aesthetic that fits well with modern audiences without losing the magic of the original. Each location feels like it belongs in a storybook brought to life.
The supporting cast is equally impressive. The Evil Queen, played with chilling perfection, steals every scene she's in. Her presence is magnetic, and her character feels both menacing and tragic - exactly the kind of complexity a modern fairytale villain needs. The dwarfs, while slightly modernized, still retain the humor and heart that made them so beloved in the original. They share excellent chemistry, delivering both genuine laughs and emotional moments.
The soundtrack is another highlight. The film features a combination of refreshed classics and new songs, and most of them work surprisingly well. The orchestral arrangements are grand and cinematic, making both quiet character moments and sweeping adventure scenes feel impactful. The musical numbers performed by the dwarfs and the Queen stand out as some of the film's best.
So what went wrong? Sadly, the answer lies with Snow White herself. The lead actress delivers a performance so flat and disconnected that it drags down almost every scene she appears in. Snow White is supposed to be the emotional heart of the story - a symbol of kindness, hope, and inner strength. Yet here, she comes across as stiff, unconvincing, and at times, awkwardly uninterested in the world around her.
Whether it's due to poor direction, miscasting, or a lack of understanding of the character, the performance simply doesn't land. Key scenes that should have been touching - such as Snow White's interactions with the dwarfs, her wonder at discovering the forest, or her confrontation with the Queen - all feel emotionally hollow. Her line delivery often lacks emotion, and her facial expressions rarely reflect the gravity or magic of the situations unfolding around her.
It's a shame because the film itself gives her every opportunity to shine. The script is respectful to the character, the cinematography frames her beautifully, and the supporting actors do their best to lift her up, but she simply fails to carry the role. A stronger performance could have elevated the entire movie to something truly special.
That being said, Snow White (2025) is far from a failure. It still delivers a memorable cinematic experience thanks to its gorgeous visuals, impressive supporting performances, and a clear love for the source material. The film successfully balances nostalgia with a few modern updates, making it accessible to both longtime fans and new audiences.
Ultimately, Snow White (2025) is a good movie trapped beneath a weak leading performance. While it may not reach its full potential, it is still worth watching for its artistry, world-building, and the fantastic work done by everyone - except Snow White herself.",1.0,2025-03-27,2,2,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0

The story, which should be a journey full of emotions and unexpected twists, becomes a series of clichés and forced dialogues that lack depth. The characterization of Snow White is disappointing; she seems more like an archetype than a real protagonist with whom we can empathize. The dwarfs, given a new interpretation, end up being more caricatures than endearing characters, thus losing their original charm.

This was a product of poor directing and story writing.

tt6208148,rw10429044,liamirvine-77159,Fell flat,"I think Disney are missing something with these live action remakes. What made the animation movies so loved was the fact that it was created by people who truly cared about the story, about the quality of animation and the emotion shone through.

With this remake, and like The Lion King, The Little Mermaid, Lady & the Tramp, Beauty & the Beast, it feels empty and flat. There's no wonder, there's no feeling of warmth in the frames.the CGI in this film doesn't know what it wants to be. 6 of the Dwarfs are cartoonish and exaggerated whilst Dopey looks like a Pinnochio wannabe. It seems they spent so much time trying to make him so detailed that the other 6 are just plopped on the screen. They've given Dopey hair, freckles glistening eyes to make him more likeable yet his animated counterpart was drawn so basic that whatever he did, whatever expression he gave was just amplified and turned him into a favourite.

Apart from the CGI of the characters, the entire landscape feels off. The townsfolk wear the same bright colourful clothes during the evil Queens reign as they did during the Good King's. The town is exactly the same, no dilapidated houses or shops, no squalor, no disease so it got me thinking, was the queen (apart from her Vanity) all that bad?

The entire casting is way off. RZ was great in West side story but here she doesn't carry off being fairest of them all. She looks down her nose at people, she holds herself in the highest regard where Snow White is humble, graceful and unknowing, RZ comes across as arrogant, demanding and out for her own self.

Gal Gadot is without doubt the worst casting choice. She doesn't play a good evil queen. She does not carry a single scene she is in. The scene where she talks to the huntsman the first time round is laughably the worst bit of acting I've seen from her. I think she's better as a supporting character, not a leading lady and certainly not one that is supposed to radiate evilness and anger. She just does not pull it off.

I get they're trying to bring classic tales to align with the modern age but some aspects will never translate well into this new world.

I get why a lot of people are peeved with this film and it certainly does not deserve any accolades. My kids came out the cinema and said they were bored which, for a Disney film, is the worst review you could get.

I'm not even exaggerating, this thing was a snooze fest from start to finish. I thought it'd be cool since it's Disney and they usually make dope stuff, but nah, this was a straight-up letdown. I'm gonna break it down for you because I've got a lot to say about how much this sucked.
First off, the story? Boring AF. Like, I get it's a remake of the old fairy tale, but did it have to feel so dead? It's Snow White, the girl with the seven dwarfs and the evil queen, but this time it's all live-action and modern or whatever. Except it's not exciting at all. It drags on forever, and I kept checking my phone because I couldn't care less about what was happening. They tried to make it all ""girl power"" and stuff, which is fine, I guess, but it just felt forced and lame. The plot was so predictable I could've told you the ending five minutes in. Evil Queen hates Snow White, poisons her with an apple, blah blah blah-nothing new, nothing fun. It's like they didn't even try to switch it up.
Then there's Rachel Zegler playing Snow White. Dude, she's supposed to be the star, right? But she's so meh. Like, she's pretty and can sing, I'll give her that, but her character has zero personality. She just walks around looking sad or smiling at the dwarfs, and I'm like, ""Girl, do something!"" I didn't feel bad for her or cheer for her or anything. She's just... there. I don't know if it's her fault or the script's, but either way, Snow White was a total snooze. I wanted to root for her, but I couldn't because she was so basic.
Oh, and the dwarfs? Don't even get me started. They're these weird CGI things now, not real people, and it's so creepy. Like, they look like they're from a bad video game or something. I get they didn't want to use real little people or whatever, but these computer dudes were not it. They're supposed to be funny and cute, like in the cartoon, but nah, they just made me uncomfortable. Every time they showed up, I was like, ""Ew, what are those?"" It totally took me out of the movie. They had names and stuff-Doc, Grumpy, whatever-but I didn't care because they looked so fake and dumb.
The one kinda okay part was Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen. She's pretty dope, and you can tell she's trying to make it work. She's all evil and smirky, and her outfits are fire, so that's something. But even she couldn't save this trainwreck. Like, she's the best thing in it, but the movie's so bad around her that it doesn't even matter. She's out here being all menacing and cool, but the story's too weak to back her up. It's like putting sprinkles on a burnt cupcake-it's still trash.
The whole look of the movie is alright, I guess. The costumes and sets are pretty, and it's all colorful and shiny. But that's not enough when everything else is garbage. It's like they spent all their money on making it look nice but forgot to make it fun to watch. And it's so freaking long, dude. I don't even know how long exactly, but it felt like three hours of nothing. I was squirming in my seat, ready to bounce, but I stuck it out just to say I saw the whole thing. Big mistake.
They tried to add new songs and stuff, but they're forgettable. I can't even hum one right now, that's how blah they were. The old songs like ""Whistle While You Work"" are in there, but they don't hit the same. It's like they wanted to be all modern and deep, but it just comes off cheesy and lame. I'd rather watch the cartoon again than sit through this mess.
Honestly, Disney dropped the ball hard. Why even remake Snow White if you're gonna make it this bad? It's not magical or fun or anything like the original. It's just a cash grab that didn't even grab my attention. I was so hyped for it too, because I love fairy tales and Disney movies, but this was a total waste of my time. One star, and that's me being nice because Gal Gadot tried. If you're thinking about watching it, just don't. Save yourself the pain, seriously. This movie's going straight to the trash bin in my brain. Ugh.",1.0,2025-03-27,2,3,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0

tt6208148,rw10410085,muzotime-57720,Awful performance of gal gadot,"Expanding on the initial statement, my consistent disappointment with Gal Gadot's performances extends beyond this particular film and permeates her overall filmography. Her vocal delivery frequently lacks the necessary inflection and dynamism to truly engage the audience, often presenting as a flat and monotonous drone that hinders the emotional resonance of her lines. This absence of vocal variation makes it challenging to fully invest in her characters and their experiences. Moreover, her portrayal of emotions often feels superficial and unconvincing. Whether the scene calls for joy, sorrow, or anger, the depth and nuance required to create a believable and impactful emotional connection with the viewer seem to be consistently missing. This latest role, unfortunately, has only served to solidify my long-held opinion regarding her limitations as an actress. The nuances and complexities that could have elevated the character were lost, further highlighting a fundamental lack of acting prowess.
Beyond the technical aspects of her performance, there is also a persistent sense of haughty arrogance that emanates from her on-screen persona. This perceived self-importance can be distracting and creates a barrier between the character and the audience, making it difficult to empathize or connect with her motivations. It often feels as though she is presenting rather than embodying the role. Furthermore, her on-screen presence appears to be plagued by an internal conflict, a kind of identity crisis that manifests in performances that are jarringly inconsistent. At times, she seems to overcompensate, resulting in exaggerated and theatrical portrayals that lack subtlety and realism. Conversely, there are moments where she appears underwhelming and detached, failing to command the scene or leave a lasting impression. This constant fluctuation between being over-the-top and surprisingly bland creates a disjointed and ultimately unsatisfying viewing experience. The lack of a grounded and consistent characterization makes it impossible to fully immerse oneself in the narrative. In conclusion, considering her persistent struggles with vocal delivery, emotional depth, a perceived air of arrogance, and inconsistent character portrayals, I remain convinced that Gal Gadot's casting in this and other significant film projects has been a disservice to the potential of those stories and a source of ongoing disappointment for me as a viewer.

tt6208148,rw10408617,imdbfan-6004737470,Disappointing.. ://,"I just got out of the new Snow White movie, and I have to vent. This was one of the most disappointing remakes I've seen in a long time. I went in with low expectations, but somehow, it still managed to let me down. I don't even know where to start, but let's just go piece by piece.
First off, Snow White herself. I don't know what they were thinking with this casting, but she just didn't fit the role at all. Snow White is supposed to be this sweet, innocent, almost ethereal character, and instead, we got someone who felt way too modern and out of place. She didn't have that fairytale charm, and honestly, she didn't even seem to want to be there. Like, if you're going to play THE Snow White, at least try to capture the magic of the character. Instead, she was just kind of... there. No warmth, no wonder, just flat delivery and attitude that felt more like a reluctant Disney Channel character than a timeless princess.
And don't even get me started on the story changes. They basically gutted everything that made Snow White special in the first place. The entire point of her character was that she was kind, trusting, and innocent in a world that was cruel, and that goodness is what ultimately saved her. But nope, that was apparently too outdated, so instead, they made her some kind of independent warrior figure who doesn't need saving. Look, I get updating old stories, but when you strip away the heart of the original, why even call it Snow White? It felt like they wanted to use the name but had zero interest in actually telling the story that people love.
Then there's the dwarfs-or, well, the lack of dwarfs. This part made me so mad. Instead of the classic seven dwarfs, we got this weird group of random people that didn't have any of the charm or personality that made the originals so memorable. Grumpy, Dopey, Doc, Bashful-gone. Instead, we get these generic side characters that have zero chemistry with Snow White. It's like the filmmakers didn't understand that the dwarfs weren't just background filler; they were the heart of the movie. Their friendship with Snow White is what made the original so emotional, and without that, the story just felt hollow.
And the Evil Queen? SUCH a letdown. She was supposed to be one of the most iconic villains of all time-vain, terrifying, and absolutely ruthless. But here, she was just... fine? Not menacing, not particularly interesting, just there. They tried to make her more ""complex,"" but in doing so, they sucked all the fun out of her character. Like, can we please just let villains be villains without over-explaining their motivations? The Evil Queen is iconic because she's obsessed with beauty and will do anything to maintain her status, and that's all she needs to be. I wanted a commanding, over-the-top presence, and instead, I got a watered-down, forgettable performance.
Also, the visuals. You'd think a Snow White remake would be visually stunning, right? A dreamlike fairytale world, beautiful costumes, something that really captures that magical, old-school Disney feel. Nope. Everything looked weirdly flat and uninspired. The CGI was painfully obvious, the costumes felt like cheap cosplay, and the whole thing lacked that whimsical, storybook aesthetic that should've been a given. It's Snow White-a movie that should look like a painting come to life-but instead, it had all the magic of a generic fantasy show on a streaming service.
And the music? Completely forgettable. The original had some of Disney's most iconic songs, and instead of embracing that, they either ditched them entirely or reworked them into bland, uninspired numbers. Like, Heigh-Ho? Someday My Prince Will Come? Nope. Gone. Replaced with... honestly, I can't even remember. That's how unmemorable it was.
Overall, the whole movie just felt like it was embarrassed to be Snow White. Like the filmmakers wanted to distance themselves from everything that made the original special while still slapping the name on it to cash in on nostalgia. It wasn't fun, it wasn't magical, and it definitely wasn't the Snow White we grew up with. Just a soulless, watered-down mess that completely missed the point.
Save yourself the disappointment and just rewatch the original.",1.0,2025-03-27,2,3,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0
tt6208148,rw10408838,ReelTalkSeb,Disney's Snow White (2024): A Soulless Remake That Betrays a Classic,"It is a shame that Disney decided to distort one of its most iconic stories in such a way. The original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs from 1937 was a timeless classic, a milestone in animation history that remains beloved to this day. But instead of honoring this legacy, Disney's new Snow White adaptation has left both fans and critics scratching their heads in disbelief.
The biggest mistake of this remake is undoubtedly the casting of Rachel Zegler as Snow White. From the very beginning, she was a controversial choice, and her public comments about the original film only made matters worse. Zegler repeatedly stated that the 1937 movie was outdated and no longer relevant to modern society. Statements like these raise serious doubts about whether she has any real respect for the character she is supposed to portray. Her performance as Snow White is uninspired and artificial, lacking the grace, warmth, and charm that made the original character so beloved. She simply does not have the acting ability to carry a role that has been synonymous with Disney magic for nearly a century.
But as if that weren't bad enough, Disney made yet another baffling choice: casting Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen. While Gadot may be known for her role as Wonder Woman, that does not automatically make her a capable actress. Her performance feels stiff and lacks any real menace-far from the dark, intimidating presence that the Queen had in the original film. While she may have the general appearance for the role, her acting remains flat and uninspired. She fails to bring even a fraction of the depth or cruelty needed to portray such an iconic villain convincingly.
Beyond the miscast leads, the movie is filled with one questionable decision after another. The seven dwarfs have been almost entirely removed or replaced with a random collection of characters that bear little resemblance to the original concept. This alone demonstrates how little respect the filmmakers have for the film's legacy. The beautiful music of the original has either been altered beyond recognition or discarded altogether because it was deemed ""outdated."" But it was precisely this music that made Snow White so unforgettable-a true fairytale experience brought to life through enchanting melodies.
Disney seems to be moving further away from the values that once made its classics so magical. Instead of creating films filled with heart and wonder, they continue to push soulless modern adaptations that no one asked for. Fans don't want watered-down reinterpretations that desperately try to appear progressive; they want the fairy-tale beauty and emotional depth that Disney used to master so effortlessly.
The overwhelmingly negative reaction to the first trailer should have been a warning. But Disney ignored the criticism and pushed forward anyway. In the end, they have delivered a film that fails to satisfy either old fans or new audiences. Snow White is a story rich in symbolism, beauty, and timeless storytelling-all of which have been completely discarded in this remake. Those who want to experience the true magic of Snow White should simply watch the 1937 original.",1.0,2025-03-27,2,4,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0

tt6208148,rw10397598,historyfreak356,The Poison Apple looked better than this film,"Now I really want to ask the Magic Mirror on the wall what's the WORST Disney remake of them all?

I saw this movie opening day just to see how it was and felt like I had a bite of the poison apple that night. Visually this film looked great but the plot, lack of character development and songs ruined everything else.

After the opening ""Once Upon a Time"" introduction we don't even get 1 word of spoken dialogue instead we're thrust right into a song from the beginning. Absolutely none of the new songs they added to this film were good they were cringe worthy and forgettable at best. Even Gal Gadot's songs as the Evil Queen were lame the lyrics for her songs could have been written better by a five-year-old. The CGI on the dwarves was a bit off putting but they had some fun moments. They were one of the few good highlights of this film. Unlike Snow White's love interest who was the leader of a group of bandits the Dwarves character development was more well done than his or anyone else's. So, the main plot of the film was an oppressed starving kingdom is trying to rise up against their evil queen. That sounds like a good idea on paper but when it involves a bunch of robbers hiding in a forest it made me wonder: when did this movie turn into Robin Hood?!

SEVEN plot devices about this movie that made absolutely no sense...

1. The Queen's demise after she destroyed her own magic mirror out of rage 2. How Snow White easily convinced Queen's bodyguards to turn against their ruler 3. Again, why did they basically use the plot of Robin Hood?

4. Why did they allow Dopey to talk? I preferred the more ambiguous goofy animated version where we didn't know what he was thinking because he didn't know how to speak 5. Reducing the dwarves screen time in favor of giving the bandits resistance group more screen time 6. Snow White trying to find her long lost Father a quest that never got underway and went nowhere 7. Why did the Queen reveal herself in her old woman disguise right before Snow White seemingly died from the poison apple? Her enemy spies could have easily eavesdropped in on the conversation?! It's the typical cliche of when the villain doesn't know when to stop talking!

They made some weird choices when they reworked the script and not for the better. The actors were all pretty good. Gal Gadot comes off the worse for not being anymore than a two dimensional villanelle and the song she sings is a low point. But I don't think the actress is to blame... it's the scriptwriters that do the most damage. The ending is disappointing and over simple. Even the 1930s animation had a better ending. But my biggest problem is the iconic glass coffin. It's nowhere to be seen and instead Snow White is planted on a rock! Really weird. Overall. Pretty enjoyable and some nice songs but no depth.

There weren't even that many cute forest animals like the old movie. I wanted to see her talk to birds or a deer or something, but nope.
The seven dwarfs weren't really funny. I didn't even know who was who. In the old movie, one sneezes a lot and one is grumpy, and that's funny. These ones just kind of stood there and talked a little and didn't make me laugh at all.
Also, the Queen wasn't super scary. She didn't turn into a witch with a scary apple or say ""Mirror, mirror"" in a cool voice. I was waiting for that and it never happened. That's my favorite part!
The dresses weren't pretty like I hoped. Snow White didn't wear the yellow, blue, and red one from the old movie, and I really wanted to see that. And there weren't any fun songs I remembered. I couldn't even hum any after the movie because they weren't catchy.

In the original, Snow White sings as she speaks, and the animals communicate with her. She is supposed to be gentle, loving, and caring toward all life. However, this live-action adaptation completely ignored those elements.
There was no singing for Snow White, which is a major departure from the original. The movie felt too modern, straying too far from the classic animated version. The songs and themes should have paid tribute to the beloved original, but they didn't. The costumes were also poorly designed, and the animals didn't even talk-something that would have been essential in a faithful adaptation.
Rachel Zegler, who plays Snow White, neither looks the part nor sings. Her acting skills were disappointing, and her off-screen personality doesn't align with the warmth and kindness that Snow White embodies. Disney should have cast someone who genuinely reflects those qualities.
For example, Selena Gomez would have been a much better choice. She can sing, is loved by millions, and actively advocates for others. If Disney had cast someone like her, the movie might have received better ratings and performed better at the box office.

tt6208148,rw10405033,EntertainmentTales,"Well, This Happened","For the record, I do like Marc Webb as a director. Great filmmaker with generally a great creative mind and eye for detail with whatever material he deals with.
With Snow White, I was generally able to look past the casting. Rachel Zegler is a fine actress and the way Disney is, it should have been no surprise they would go in that direction and it's not her fault they paid her millions to play the role.
However, the big red flag was the cast, crew and Disney themselves almost denouncing the original film as outdated and offensive, cause lord knows that's how you promote your remake of a film that your studio made. They also seem to forget that it wasn't even Disney's story, it was based on a classic fairytale.
Plot-wise, this is fairly close to the original. It's brand new, so I'll refrain from giving away too much. However, if you've seen Disney's recent remakes or reimagining's, you could probably guess what things they might have kept and what they changed to ""modernize"" this in their way.
With that said, the changes did cause me to roll my eyes a bit. Particularly with the changes to the Prince...sorry Jonathan and Snow White herself. Gal Gadot does really well as the Queen and kind of made me wish for a while movie about her instead of the remake. She is actually the one that kept this film partially afloat for me.
The Seven Dwarfs, for the most part were a big relief. They kept them far closer to the original than I and so many thought. So, that was a relief.
So overall, I'll give this a 3/10. I forgave it a little more than most because my kid did love it, so that counts. However, it's easy to see why many weren't forgiving because these changes from Disney are getting a little tiring and I think this film proved how burnt many are feeling from these lackluster remakes.",3.0,2025-03-26,1,1,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0

Disney somehow managed to suck all the magic, charm, and fun out of a classic and replace it with a preachy, lifeless mess.
What went wrong?
Where are the dwarfs? One of the most iconic parts of the story is gone, replaced by random companions that have zero personality or chemistry. Why even call it Snow White if you're just going to rewrite everything?
Snow White herself... yikes. The lead actress might be talented, but her take on the character is cold and unlikable. Snow White is supposed to be kind and full of wonder, but here she's just... kind of smug? Instead of inspiring, she just lectures everyone.
The Prince? Nope. Apparently, romance is outdated now, so they just removed the Prince altogether. The original story wasn't about a girl waiting to be saved-it was about kindness and believing in love. Now, it's just a dull hero's journey with no heart.
The visuals are shockingly bad. Disney has the budget for breathtaking CGI, but somehow, this film looks cheap and lifeless. The forest is bland, the creatures look weird, and even the costumes feel off.
The songs? Forgettable. You won't be humming any of these tracks after leaving the theater. They pale in comparison to the classics, and none of them have that Disney magic.

I have never seen a movie this awful, in cinema i regret paying it and i want my money back. Snow White is a complete and utter disaster from start to finish. The plot doesnt make sense it feels like it was written by a group of sleep-deprived toddlers randomly mashing a keyboard. Nothing makes sense, and the story drags on and just suffocating my eyes, also it iwas just 30 minutes in and i'm already regret but i can't just walk out without watching because that would feel like more money wasted.

The characters are goofy, their lines are cringe. Feels like the movie is directed by some middle schoolers who are autistic. Every line of dialogue sounds like it was written by someone who has never spoken to a human before. The humor is non-existent like a bland joke. Every attempted joke is painfully awkward, forced, and downright embarrassing. I didn't even crack a smile-I just cringed it.

This movie is a crime against cinema. It's not just bad; it's offensively bad. A complete waste of money, time, and brain cells. If you're thinking of watching it, do yourself a favor and burn your money instead-it'll be more entertaining.",1.0,2025-03-31,1,1,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0

This version sees Rachel Zegler playing the main lead who runs away from her kingdom as her evil stepmother(Gal Gadot) wants her dead so she can rule the kingdom. From there Snow meets a bunch of dwarves and later meets a rogue thief named Jonathan(Andrew Burnap)who she later falls for. But will the queen find her?.

Now I have some positives and some negatives. First the negatives Gal Gadot was the worst part of this film. She reminded me of Uma Thurman from Batman and Robin meets Maya Rudolph in Disenchanted. Don't be one bit surprised if she wins Worst Actress at the Razzies in 2026. Also the dwarves are very weird yet they grew on me along with the songs which come out of nowhere. The chemistry between Andrew and Rachel was good yet he was too old for her since he was 32 during filming and she was 21.

Speaking of positives Rachel Zegler was the best part in this film along with the production design and the costumes were nice. Is it as good as Aladdin,Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella or The Little Mermaid No? But did I like it yeah I did but it's not perfect either.

Watch Mirror Mirror or the 1937 classic instead. Most disappointing film so far in 2025.",8.0,2015-05-31,19,113,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0

Now what Snow White fails to also deliver on the success of the original, this movie was really not that bad though, it did have it's wonderous charm, and a world and nice props and effects, artificial or not, it was lovely and colourful, and the effects for me gave it that spark, that image, that essence of life. Which lacks in many re-makes from the classical tales.
Zeglar, let's start with her. We'll the material wasn't much, but God damn can she act. She can sing, and as Snow White she put on a show for us, she excells in the role, she looks absolutely beutiful in that dress of hers, and whilst the songs weren't as catchy as the original, and the darker tone of the story, her music gave it a real breath of fresh air. And she was amazing in the role, her charm, charisma and notes makes her fun to watch on screen, as she was really something in that role.
Gadot-her role as the evil sorcerer was fine, nothing noteworthy and nothing that tops-the-scales. More or less just sort of their, and doing an alright job, not that awful. Her songs weren't all that cathcy, and the anti-climax was hollow and rushed through, but her performance was mered by her muffling at times, which would distract the audience.
The 7 Dwarfs-Actually, they look Hillarious, the dwarfs lit-up the show with some jokes, Narratives of people and other things. And motives, memories. And the dwarfs lit it light, they were the best part about the film, as when they were on their was magic, their was a sense of freedom, and they were all great to see on screen. Even if they did look like they were on a video game, which was videoooo cool, instead of just cool. Yes, they look absolutely Rediculous, I couldn't stop laughing.
The bad bits would be the longer duration, the props being like a stage play, but this movie really isn't 2.1 BAD, nope more better then you'd expect. The crashing and burning probably is the controversial things which could of been left out. Because the films biggest problem is the fact that it's sometimes too dark for kids, I Don't think the movie really knew it's audience, I'd say ages 10 and Upwards will heavily enjoy or be gutted with it's outcome, but no-way expressively bad.

tt6208148,rw10396013,antoniocarlosazevedo,**A Problematic Retelling of a Classic: The Live-Action Snow White Reboot.,"The live-action reboot of Snow White, an attempt to modernize the 1937 animated classic, seeks to reposition the story in a new era of Disney productions.

Rachel Zegler, in the role of the protagonist, delivers a performance that, while well-characterized, lacks cinematic naturalism. Her portrayal feels theatrical, which, for a film, comes across as misplaced. Perhaps her performance would have been better suited for a stage adaptation. The script, on the other hand, fails to captivate the audience with a consistent narrative, mainly because, at its core, it seems to lack a compelling story altogether.

Gal Gadot, as the Evil Queen, impresses with her presence but fails to enchant. Her character is presented in a shallow manner, reduced to a caricature of a vain and wicked woman, devoid of any depth or convincing justification for her motivations. While Gadot fulfills her role in the plot, the script confines her to being merely a functional piece, lacking the nuance that could have elevated her performance.

The storyline, already fragile, completely unravels after the antagonist's musical number. From that point onward, the film loses any sense of direction. Elements such as the thieves, Snow White's romantic interest, and the chase scenes involving the protagonist are handled in a confusing and disjointed way by the direction. Nonetheless, there is something to appreciate: the inclusion of the dwarfs, even recreated through CGI, adds a certain charm and nostalgia.

However, the film's greatest misstep lies in its third act. After Snow White bites the apple and falls into the ""sleep of death,"" the movie abandons any attempt at emotional or narrative coherence, opting instead for a rushed and simplistic resolution seemingly aimed at an inattentive young audience. There is no development of the protagonist's aspirations, nor any meaningful exploration of her relationships with the other characters. What is shown on screen remains shallow and superficial.

Overall, *Snow White* had the potential to be a relevant retelling, updated to align with the values and sensibilities of the 21st century. However, it fails by stripping the character of her essence and subordinating the story to a progressive agenda that, while valid, is inserted in a heavy-handed manner. As a result, the protagonist becomes a forgettable figure, far from being an inspiring role model for new generations. In its attempt to celebrate female strength and independence, the film neglects the delicate femininity that has always been an intrinsic part of the character, delivering a work that is unlikely to be remembered as a milestone for either cinema or Disney itself.",5.0,2025-03-23,4,16,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0

Disney music just isn't great anymore. I guess I'm in the minority, but I don't LIKE Lin Manuel Miranda's songwriting (I know he didn't write these, but his tone has infected everything). It's well done. And I don't like it. And that's how I feel about everything Disney is doing these days. For something to be basically well done and not be likeable seems to be an issue of tone, of trying to appeal to all the wrong instincts while abandoning some of the hallmarks of good storytelling. It's like they're making movies by committee, but the people on the committee don't like movies. Snow White (the movie) was more wholesome than I expected, but the climax wasn't climactic. It was...meh. Almost silly. There just seems to be a cultural influence through Disney lately that runs counter to the lives of the average movie goer, like they don't speak our language anymore. They're speaking over the heads of the public like they're being idealistic, but with ideals that we don't seem to share. Snow White was the least offensive in this regard of any Disney movies of late, but it still feels like something is getting lost in translation, like they're trying to say what they think we want to hear and they still don't understand it. If anything, it feels like the people who work at Disney and make their movies didn't grow up watching Disney movies. They're bringing some other cultural touchstones to bear in a playground that was built by people they don't understand or value, and it shows.",5.0,2025-03-23,21,158,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0

Let's start with the positives: Rachel Zegler gives her all with the material she's been given (especially her enjoyable rendition of ""Whistle While You Work"" that was delightful), the set design is gorgeous and some of the songs aren't that bad.
But unfortunately, i have to talk about the negatives: the plot is a jumbled mess, the changes made to the original story are unnecessary, the abysmal CGI (ESPECIALLY the Seven Dwarves that reach uncanny valley territory!) and a complete miscast of the villain played by Gal Gadot: she doesn't strike me at all as the bad guy, her performance & singing voice are so over-the-top and goofy that it's hard being invested in her, especially compared to the original which was one of the best villains in movie history (then again, the screenplay did not help her at all)

The script was, once again, not great it just not great it just felt flat. The only part I really enjoyed was the fact that my party and I got to joke about it.
It also felt rushed, especially the ending. It was like they ran out of time and had to cram it all in the last 10 minutes.
(There was also a ton of CGI)
While I enjoyed the time I got to spend with my family and friends while watching this, I don't think I would watch it again or recommend it for others. I wanted it to be better, it just wasn't 🤷‍♀️",2.0,2025-03-26,1,2,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0
tt6208148,rw10427214,brianjohnson-20043,It's bad. But not 1 Star bad.,"It's not good. Ziegler seemed alright. Godot wasn't good IMO. Lots of the new story was told via bland voice-over rather than shown and experienced. That's a big mistake in my opinion. If you're going to have voiceover establish important story developments, make it told meaningfully, or get it out of the way just at the beginning. This movie did neither.
The writing of the love connection between Snow White and the prince is better than the original. But that's an extremely low bar. And this was still not good. I also enjoyed the music a bit more. But the original movie didn't have a lot of iconic music apart from the dwarf song which this version mostly kept with a few alterations rather than risking a totally new song.
The background of Snow White's character was more interesting. The demise of the villain seemed better in concept than the original. I also like Snow White bring giving some self determination in this one. But like a lot of the ideas for this refresh, it wasn't well executed, even if there was some logic to the changes in concept. It didn't feel earned throughout the story.
The other thing that makes this bad IMO is the animation style. All of the animals and dwarves looked artificially clean, bright and well lit. All of which is visually acceptable for other animation styles. But it didn't seem acceptable for realistic CGI visuals alongside flesh and blood actors. The whole movie probably would have been better suited for a Frozen or Tangled style animation remake. Although now I fear offering the idea will keep Disney making anorher round of remakes as opposed to making any original content going forward.
Was this Snow White worse than the original to me? Probably for that last reason more than any other. The original movie despite the bland story and character development, visually worked and made sense in its 2D animation style. This version was reminiscent of Ariel being biracial with red hair in the Little Mermaid remake. I don't mind a biracial mermaid. But why the red hair, if not for honoring the legacy or the character not looking anything like a biracial mermaid. That's the issue to a lot of these remakes. Trying to make something new and different and not too different can be so much more challenging than simply producing brand new material with no historical expectation from audiences.",5.0,2025-04-02,1,2,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0

Rachel Zegler can sing and act the part. The wig could have been better but I liked her costume loads and think the story arc makes her a lot more interesting as a princess character. Little kids will love her and the songs Waiting on a wish and the duet Princess Problems are well done.

The world was very pretty. The cabin of the dwarfs and scene with Snow White sitting in the field full of flowers and animals are gorgeous. The scene with Snow White in the forest is just as scary as when I was a kid. The transition of the witches face was cool and impressive work without any distractions when the face changes but that woman can't act and her songs would have been a lot more bombastic if sung by someone who can actually sing.

The storyline of the dwarfs does not make sense to me. It feels like they left out big chunks of the movie. Why constantly zoom in on the jewels the queen has and show the mining dwarfs with magical powers and tell us that they have been to work for more than 200 years when it doesn't tie in to the story.

Controversies about her casting aside, Rachel Zegler delivers a fine performance and basically carries the movie on her shoulders (and unlike another thespian I'll mention shortly, this girl can actually act). The story was changed in a few key parts, but still falls short of the magic of the 1937 original. Among the most jarring decisions, creating the dwarves using CGI so they resemble their animated counterparts was the worst of all, rendering an uncanny valley appearance which could be easily resolved by hiring seven actual little people for the job. And the other awful aspect was the casting of Gal Gadot. I always considered her to be an average actress at best, but this must be a career worst. Barring some real stinker performance coming along in the next months, they must already be engraving her Razzie as I type these words. Certainly there were more competent actresses that could infuse some life in this role, but Gadot's wooden cartoonish performance is atrocious, and even if Disney hired her on account of her fame alone, that plan certainly backfired as her acting is being heavily criticized and the box office projections don't seem promising. In the end, the movie is passable basically on Zegler's authentic performance and a bit of nostalgia for the original animated film.

tt6208148,rw10393710,apereztenessa-1,Pretty average,"Disney's Snow White trailer promised, in capital letters: ""The classic story comes to life"". Nothing could be farther from the truth, as the more Disney makes these live action movies, the more they look like animated movies made by CGI. To the point that human actors feel almost out of place. It's as if the animation gene of the studio was too strong and it wanted to take over.
The other trend in Disney live action movies that is also visible in this Snow White is that they seem dominated by the guys making the cheap Disney Channel musicals, or the people making the Broadway shows. Highly choreographed musical numbers designed and filmed as if we were just sitting in a theatre, as opposed to with a film lens.
Beyond that, as live action Disney remakes go, Snow White is better than average without ever being great. To those criticizing the movie for steering too far from the original, it's probably worth reminding them that the original is a tale from 1812, and the 1937 Disney movie took plenty of liberties relative to that original already. So yes, it's okay for Snow White to be of latin descent, for Prince Charming not to be a prince, and so on. We expect filmmakers to adapt stories over time, and for whatever reason they want.
The issue with Disney remakes is actually that they don't evolve enough relative to the animated version. In that regard, Snow White tries harder than others. And the new scenes are where the movie seems to find its wings and is able to breathe. But it's weighed down by the requirements to reproduce entire scenes from the animated film. Long scenes where it's clear the filmmakers are checking boxes and don't have their hearts in it.",5.0,2025-03-22,2,14,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0

The result of my experience, still avoiding deeper analysis or comparisons, is that it's an okay movie. Nothing exceptional. The storyline is okay, the acting is okay (for a Disney princess movie), though there are some weak spots in the plot, as well as in the way certain moments of tension are developed and resolved. But I wouldn't call it terrible, far from it.
If I were to start making comparisons and analyzing the producers' choices (some of which I find downright ridiculous), my opinion would drop significantly. But I don't think it's fair to dislike, or hate, the movie for what I consider the wrong reasons.

Audiovisual carries the film and it's definitely a decent family watch.
In detail:
Despite the rewrites from the original Snow White story by Disney, this film still somehow pulls off a little touch of magic in its world. In this case, the two major things that uplift its quality are the music and CGI. The music really delivers its authentic feel with modern ensemble, performed beautifully by the casts. The CGI on the other hand, dwarves especially, really bring them out to life without leaving important resemblances of the classic.
Unfortunately, performance wise, Rachel Zegler (debatably) actually has it, theatrically. Definitely not for the look, character, and soul of Snow White. On Gal 's end, she has performed absolutely terribly, expressionless and unnaturally forced as usual (usual being her performance in other films). As for the other casts, they perform normally well.

tt6208148,rw10403772,imdbfan-9190292197,Different View,"The 2025 Snow White film presents an intriguing storyline that successfully reimagines the classic fairy tale while incorporating a unique blend of animation and live-action, reminiscent of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?. The visual style creates a fantastical world where animated elements seamlessly interact with human characters, giving the film a distinct and imaginative feel.
However, one notable aspect of the film is its heavy reliance on singing. While music plays a crucial role in many Disney adaptations, this version may feel overwhelming to viewers who prefer a more balanced approach to storytelling. The sheer amount of singing at times detracts from the narrative, making certain scenes feel drawn out rather than progressing the plot effectively.
Despite this, the film's resolution is satisfying and uplifting. The ending brings the kingdom's people together, emphasizing unity and the power of hope. The Evil Stepmother faces a fitting downfall, as she is ultimately banished, ensuring that peace is restored to the land. This resolution leaves the door open for further storytelling, making it a strong candidate for expansion into a television series, much like Once Upon a Time. With a rich world and well-developed characters, a series spin-off could explore deeper lore, side stories, and the continued adventures of Snow White and those around her.",5.0,2025-03-25,0,13,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0
tt6208148,rw10400391,ydfxwd,Did Sleepy direct this film?,"Snow White had its moments. Snow's interaction with Dopey was adorable; Whistle while you work was well put together and enjoyable; the soundtrack is a triumph; and the animation of the animals was beautifully heartening.

Unfortunately, this is where the enjoyability ends. I have no doubt in the acting abilities of the cast however it felt as though the direction was completely off. Nothing seemed to feel deeper than face value. As I have said, the soundtrack is excellent, however, the scenes in which they appear on screen let them down for their lacklustre and cheesy movement.

The writing also seems all wrong. Lines seem to fall out of place throughout; there is no real bonding time between Snow and the dwarves; and the queen's demise??! Voldemort 2.0. One credit to the writing is that of the relationship between Snow and Charming, but it is not enough to recover the film.

It was cringeworthy at times, but brought a smile here and there. Unfortunately though, I do not think I need to watch it again.",5.0,2025-03-24,0,9,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0
tt6208148,rw10411754,fakemikejones,From the director that destroyed the Amazing Spider-man franchise,"So let's get this out of the way first, yes this movie is boring, no Rachel Zegler is not the reason why this movie is middle of the road. Gal Gadot is completely miscast as the evil queen, at no point during the movie did I find her performance threatening or menacing. A piece of cardboard would make a better villain than she did. Gal does her best to cover up her heavy accent to deliver a more even keel voice, but it's all for naught. It's even more painfully apparent during the musical numbers. Gal delivers such a flat, off key performance, it's brutal to watch.
Honestly, Rachel Zegler is the bright spot of the movie, she delivers a passionate performance as Snow White, you can tell how dedicated she was to the role. When Rachel and Gal are on screen together, it truly shows you how absolutely outclassed Gal is by Rachel's talent. She embodies Snow White completely, delivering grace even at her lowest points.
Turning the prince into the leader of a bandit gang was an enjoyable change of pace, Andrew Burnap is charming enough, and gives the role of ""the Prince"" more depth. He lacks a commanding presence though and he ends up looking like a guy just chasing around Snow White.
Making the dwarves CGI was a choice. I would have preferred live action performers myself. Each one has its own personality and they are all charming in their own way. Funnily enough, outside of Snow White, the dwarves feel the most fleshed out of the other characters. It's never explained why they mine for gems but considering how obsessed this version of the Evil Queen is with jewels, I thought it would have been a nice twist if they thought they were mining for Snow White's original family and in fact were mining for the Evil Queen. It would have given them more stakes in the movie and a stronger reason to ally themselves with Snow White.",5.0,2025-03-28,0,4,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0
tt6208148,rw10406806,sutalosimun,It has a potential,"This film, although it caught my attention before its premiere, left me with mixed impressions. My initial reaction was positive, especially due to the expanded dynamic between Snow White and Jonathan, as well as the additional interaction between Snow White and the Evil Queen, which was a refreshing change from the original. However, the key issue with the film lies in its story structure. The creators removed important segments that defined Snow White as a character while introducing new elements that did not play a significant role in the plot's development. This shift in narrative focus resulted in an uneven pace and a loss of the emotional depth that the original had.

One of the most obvious shortcomings is the reduced interaction between Snow White and the dwarfs. Their relationship, which was the heart of the classic version, is minimized here. Snow White is portrayed as a leader, which makes sense from a modern perspective, but in doing so, her warmth, kindness, and gentleness-traits that made her recognizable and beloved-are lost. There are no touching scenes like kissing the dwarfs goodbye before they leave for the mine, baking an apple pie, or communicating with animals-key motifs from the original story. As a result, her character feels more distant, and her connection with other characters appears shallow.

Despite the issues with the script and story structure, the film does have its strengths. Rachel Zegler deserves praise for her vocal performances and acting, and the musical segments are one of the film's brighter aspects. The visual elements and production quality are also impressive, but they are not enough to compensate for the lack of emotional connection and consistency in storytelling. Ultimately, this reboot fails to capture the magic of the original because it focuses too much on modernization without understanding the essence of the story that has been cherished for generations.",5.0,2025-03-26,0,44,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0

The first review I read criticized Snow White's hair, when the reason why it looks so bad was made obvious early in the movie. For all of the clueless haters out there, it was intentional. You don't deserve more than that.
I saw it yesterday and absolutely loved it!
In contrast, the original movie is now very archaic, both in style and in the storytelling. Personally, the original Snow White's voice really grates on my nerves. She reminds me of some sort of Betty Boop character. In the original version, Snow White is basically a victim, who is rescued by her ""true love,"" with whom she has not even had a simple conversation. To be blunt, she is not much of a role model.
This interpretation, building upon the original structure, is much more complex, full of depth, and Snow White is a much stronger lead now, as is her love interest, Jonathan. They are both taking an active role in pushing back against the evil queen to restore their once-happy kingdom. Rachel (such a beautiful voice) and Andrew were relatable and made for a great couple. Gal Gadot did a great job as the very, very evil stepmother/queen. And I loved the expanded role of the dwarfs, especially Dopey, of course!
I thought the visuals were beautiful, and enjoyed most of the music. I was already a big fan of composers Pasek and Paul (The Greatest Showman, Smash, La La Land, 2019 live action Aladdin).
I believe that this updated version will be much more appealing to kids (especially little girls). I hope that they will take to heart the four words on Snow White's heart pendant: ""Fearless, Fair, Brave, True.""
And for adults who are feeling nostalgic for Disney fairytales, I hope that this movie brings you some joy!",9.0,2025-03-26,9,126,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0

Absolutely worth the watch!! It's up there with Cinderella on the level of creative writing and love for the original character.

The only nitpicks I have are:
Actual Dwarves instead of CGI Dwarves... but I guess Dinklage needed to have that word of privilege as if he was the one true spokesperson of all Dwarves and Little People. However, I thought that the CGI dwarves were very well animated. I was super impressed with it.


One Song should have been incorporated since there was a love interest.


The animation for the way the Evil Queen died could have been animated in a less cringe way. It's so stereotypical for the villain to reach out for the protagonist as they die.

It doesn't really fit as a children's movie, a musical, it's not exactly fantasy, I just don't get what I am watching and while it has a lot of what you can expect from Disney, I just don't buy into the story.

The movie has all the original story points, and just expands on this - which I think is what the remakes should do! Be nostalgic but also bring something new to the party.
Gal Gadot was miscast - this part could have been so fun with the right actress. I think issue is Gal Gadot can't get the evilness across without beeing cartoonish sit in leather chair and pet a cat kind of way.

If I went for the actors, I'd never go see a Tom Cruise movie, which while good movies on the whole, I find him deplorable. But that's beside the point. I enjoyed some of the songs, especially Waiting on a Wish. I found the story much better constructed, because at least Snow White doesn't die in the end in her ""cloud castle"", which come on. Ending in a castle in the sky isn't a great ending however you paint it. I'm happy the huntsman wasn't murdered for showing mercy, I'm happy the prince wasn't this boring dude that we don't know much about, and I'm glad she went back and reclaimed her fathers throne. I'd have preferred her to get it back by stabbing the evil queen with the magical glass sword. However, since it's a film for children, that's not really a kid appropriate message. Sure the dwarves were a little quirky but they are non-existent magical creatures, mining piles of gems and living hundreds of year so I don't know what to tell you.

Rachel Zegler has a beautiful voice and Gal Gadot as the evil queen is great. Sure, her singing is nothing impressive, but the cast makes it into a fun and spirited group effort. I like the addition of Jonathan and his bandits. It could have been fleshed out a bit more, but they are not the focus of the story. Snow white and Dopey's relationship was lovely and made me teary eyed. I gave this movie a 10 because I was very entertained, loved the music and can recommend it to friends and family.",10.0,2025-03-30,3,29,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0

Nothing about this version of Snow White worked. The lead performance was stiff and completely lacked charm, and the supporting cast had all the depth of cardboard cutouts. The story dragged with zero emotional payoff, and the dialogue felt like it was written by someone who skimmed a Wikipedia summary of the original fairy tale.

There was no magic, no heart, no sense of wonder - just a lifeless, preachy mess trying way too hard to be modern while forgetting what made the original a classic.

From start to finish, it was a magical experience. The songs were incredibly catchy-we caught ourselves humming a few of them on the way home-and they added a lot of charm and energy to the story. The production was stunning, with beautiful costumes, sets, and visuals that really brought the fairy tale world to life.
What stood out most for me as a parent was how well the film balanced its tone. It had just the right mix of light suspense and gentle humor, without being too intense or frightening for younger kids. There were a few moments of tension, but nothing that felt overwhelming or too dark. My child was fully engaged throughout, laughing at the funny parts and wide-eyed during the magical moments.
Overall, it was a wonderfully age-appropriate film with a classic fairy tale feel and a heartwarming message. A great choice for a family movie outing, especially with younger children.",10.0,2025-03-24,10,154,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0

tt6208148,rw10403266,sky_sam,Meandering and pointless movie with some endearing moments,"Well... this live action started decent enough with a bucolic and fairytale-sque atmosphere, but it devolved fast into a meandering mess of incoherent elements. The end basically kills the movie with its utterly stupid and self contradictory final scenes.

Snow White is suggested to the audience as this 'brave, true and fierce' princess that is not passive, and is not waiting around to be saved ... except that she is actually a static character in most of the movie. Everything she accomplishes is still accomplished through her inspiring of other people who actually fight for her actively . The height of her journey is deciding to march with a crowd of unarmed townsfolk toward the castle to drive away her magical evil stepmother and her army by the power of asking nicely and refusing to defend herself or attack the queen. The height of her political acumen is deciding to bake pies with her hungry villagers to remind them life is not just surviving. Children can buy that nonsense, teens and adults will find most of what Sniw does or says utter drivel.

Performances by individual actors were okay but not great. Gadot was very underutilized considering she is the antagonist, and so were the dwarves. The little we got of them was good tough.

Costumes were ugly when not average, songs were nice but not outstanding, the plot moved at a snail pace until it rushed to the ending instead of building up tension and resolving in a satisfying manner.

The love story between Snow and Jonathan was oddly reminiscent of the dynamic between Rapulzel and Flynn Rider, which felt out place but it was entertaining enough.

Mostly it felt like this movie was a mix of elements that did not meld well together and it lacked true direction or character. Everything was very superficial.

Still, there was some fun and enjoyment to be found if you didn't take the story too seriously. Accept it won't make sense and keep your expectations low.",4.0,2025-03-25,4,3,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0
tt6208148,rw10405578,Batsy1501,So much worse than I expected !,"I just finished watching the 2025 live-action version of ""Snow White,"" and honestly, I'm left with mixed feelings. Why do I say it's worse than I expected?

To be fair, the movie does have a few good aspects, but they just can't overshadow its massive flaws. Let's start with the positives:

The Positives Rachel Zegler's Performance Rachel Zegler's performance is probably the one bright spot in the entire movie. Admittedly, her Snow White appearance feels a bit off, but her acting is solid. And her singing? Very impressive! Her musical sequences are quite enjoyable, though honestly, I think there were too many of them. If they'd cut back on the singing just a little, it would've been better.

Visuals and Costumes This part, I'm not 100% sure about. The CGI at times felt quite fake and unnatural. But the animals, like the deer, rabbits, and squirrels, were adorable and had that signature Disney charm, with expressive and emotional designs reminiscent of ""Enchanted."" The costume and makeup design were also decent-modern yet still retaining a fairy tale vibe. Oh, and when the Evil Queen wore an outfit resembling the original animated version? Stunning. Truly beautiful.

Music As for the soundtrack? While I understand this is a musical, they overdid it with the singing. Honestly, both ""Snow White"" and ""Joker 2"" are examples of how musicals can be poorly executed. There are still a few good songs, though. For instance, I really enjoyed the dwarfs singing ""Heigh Ho"" while mining for diamonds-it was fun. But most of the songs were forgettable.

The Negatives Now, onto the criticisms. And oh boy, where do I start?

A Messy and Unfocused Plot The storyline is so chaotic! None of the subplots introduced are fully developed. The movie attempts to modernize the fairy tale by adding new characters and elements, but instead of improving the story, these changes make it more confusing and harder to follow. For instance, replacing Prince Charming with Jonathan and adding a group of forest thieves had potential, but their roles weren't fleshed out enough for the audience to connect with them. I actually think replacing the random prince with Jonathan was an okay idea, but the execution was lacking. The introduction of so many side characters diluted the main storyline, making the film lose focus.

Flat Supporting Characters The supporting characters were painfully bland, especially the Evil Queen, played by Gal Gadot. Yes, the Queen looked stunning-absolutely gorgeous-but her acting? Underwhelming. I've never thought Gal Gadot was a particularly great actress, but her previous roles were at least decent. In this film, though, something just felt off. Honestly, I think the main issue lies in the script. The Evil Queen's character was poorly written. Despite being called the ""Evil Queen,"" her evilness was barely explored, and her motivations felt shallow and unconvincing.

Lackluster Climax The climax was so anticlimactic! It felt like the movie was building up to something grand, but when the resolution came, it was rushed and disappointing. If you enjoy epic endings, this will definitely let you down.

Conclusion In conclusion, the 2025 live-action ""Snow White"" left me very disappointed, even though my expectations were already low. While there are a few highlights, like Rachel Zegler's singing, some charming visuals, and a touch of Disney magic, the overall experience is weighed down by a messy script, bland characters, and forgettable music and choreography.

I wouldn't recommend going to the theater to watch this, especially not right now.",5.0,2025-03-26,1,13,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0
tt6208148,rw10433884,imdbfan-6700060090,I Luv It,"The live-action Snow White movie is, without a doubt, one of the most magical and breathtaking adaptations ever made. I never expected to love it as much as I did, but by the end, I was completely blown away. It takes everything you remember from the classic fairy tale and gives it a bold, fresh twist while keeping the heart of the story alive. If you're okay with spoilers, keep reading-because there's a lot to talk about!

From the very first scene, the movie pulls you into a stunning fantasy world filled with enchanted forests, dark castles, and glowing creatures. Snow White, played by an incredibly charming and talented actress, is reimagined as not just a sweet and kind-hearted girl, but also as a brave, curious, and intelligent leader. She's not waiting around for someone to save her-she's ready to save herself and her kingdom.

The Evil Queen is just as iconic. Her backstory is expanded in this version, showing how she was once kind, but power and jealousy twisted her. She uses dark magic from a mysterious enchanted mirror that feeds on vanity and fear. When the Queen realizes Snow White is not only more beautiful but also loved by the people, she casts the infamous spell and sends the huntsman to kill her. Here's where the movie surprises you-the huntsman, instead of just sparing her, joins her on the run and becomes a mentor, teaching her how to survive in the wild.

The seven dwarfs are also reimagined in a brilliant way. Instead of being simple comic relief, each of them has a unique skill and backstory. One is a healer, another is a blacksmith, and another is a retired knight. They help Snow White train, and together they form a kind of mini-rebellion to take down the Queen. Their bond feels real and emotional-you'll definitely tear up when one of them sacrifices himself during the castle siege in the final act.

Speaking of the final act-wow. Snow White disguises herself as a court musician to sneak back into the castle, while the dwarfs and forest creatures launch an all-out attack on the Queen's army. The Queen tricks Snow White into eating the poisoned apple, of course, but the twist? The true love's kiss comes not from a prince-but from one of the dwarfs, who always believed in her and loved her for her heart and courage. It's emotional and totally earned.

In the end, the Queen's mirror shatters, destroying her magic, and peace is restored. Snow White becomes queen-not because she married someone-but because she earned it. She rules with kindness, wisdom, and strength.

This movie was everything I hoped for and more. The visuals were stunning, the characters were rich and deep, and the message was beautiful. It's about inner beauty, bravery, and building your own destiny. The live-action Snow White is not just a fairy tale-it's a masterpiece.

tt6208148,rw10428650,imdbfan-2124825968,People are too harsh on a well known tale.,"Exactly like the title says. People are being way too harsh on a Disney adaptation. What Disney just offered is not precisely new or even drastic. In the whole world of adaptations the tale of SnowWhite being a leader has been done before. This time even modernizing the tale wasn't that big of a deal. People are acting as if this tale means the ending of the brand. Maybe people should start seeing this movie with the eyes of a child and not with eyes of a critical expert in cinema adult POV. . The elements you expect to see from the tale are present in this movie just with more context. What I loved is that we do actually get to see more of SnowWhite and her love interest which we don't get the chance to do so in the animated movie. Also the songs are really good and catchy. Again, people are acting so dense over a good classic adaptation. Is it a perfect live action? No but definitely it's not the worse thing ever as people are claiming so badly.",10.0,2025-04-03,4,45,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0
tt6208148,rw10405062,Christn0ah,Live Action Remake of Snow White is actually amazing,"Disney's 2025 live-action reimagining of ""Snow White"" has arrived, and while it attempts to modernize the classic fairy tale, it ultimately stumbles, leaving audiences with a mixed bag of disappointment and fleeting moments of charm. Directed by Marc Webb, the film stars Rachel Zegler as Snow White and Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen, promising a fresh perspective on the beloved story. However, several missteps prevent it from achieving true ""amazing"" status.
One of the most significant issues lies in the film's script. The dialogue often feels clunky and unnatural, lacking the whimsical charm of the original. Key plot points are altered, but these changes don't necessarily enhance the story, sometimes even detracting from its emotional core. The seven dwarfs, a crucial element of the original, are reimagined with CGI that falls into the uncanny valley, proving more distracting than endearing.
Rachel Zegler's performance as Snow White is a highlight. She brings a refreshing sincerity and strength to the character, portraying her as more proactive and less passive than in the animated version. Her vocal talents are undeniable, and she delivers the new songs with passion but Disney could have hired another actor who's white as snow because in the animated movie the magic mirror describes snow white's skin as ""white as snow"".
Gal Gadot's portrayal of the Evil Queen is another bright spot. She infuses the character with a captivating blend of vanity and menace, making her a compelling antagonist. Her performance hints at the potential the film had, but it's ultimately overshadowed by the weaker aspects of the production.
Visually, ""Snow White"" is a mixed bag. While some scenes capture the fairytale atmosphere, others suffer from cheap-looking CGI and uninspired set design.
The film's attempts to modernize the story also fall flat. While updating certain aspects for contemporary audiences is understandable, ""Snow White"" seems unsure of its target audience, resulting in a film that doesn't fully satisfy either nostalgic fans of the original or those seeking a fresh, modern take.
But overall the film is really good! I didn't like where the seven dwarfs were CGI and they could've replaced them with real actors with dwarfism. But other than that it's honestly quite spectacular.",10.0,2025-03-26,8,118,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0
tt6208148,rw10395473,diversecleaning,5 year olds are not the target audience,"5 year olds are not the target audience -
This is a live action remake, with a plot and animation style which are not intended for young children.
It's child-friendly, and children can enjoy the colors/the singing, but by no means were children thought of as the primary target audience of this film..
The casting (while certainly diverse), is not hurt by the casting of Rachel Zegler, nor Gal Godot.
Disney would be far better off making a much darker film (for adults), than they were here (straddling the line between a film for adults and a film for all ages).
These live-actions are not popular with young children, yet they are not dark enough for the adult audience which grew up with these films and who actually wants to see the films.
Children have a 5-20 minute attention span and generally appear to care more about the colors and cartoon/animation... Yet, Snow-White a long with The Lion King (amongst others) lack a meaningful story to keep the adults entertained.
Either go back to fully animated films, or make these films for a PG-13 audience (since children are not watching more than a few minutes of any of these live-action remakes).",10.0,2025-03-22,10,159,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0

The performances are equally mesmerizing-Snow White's character is given new depth, making her a stronger and more independent heroine while still capturing the charm of the original.
The Evil Queen is a standout, with a chilling yet captivating presence that makes every scene she's in unforgettable. The music is beautifully reworked, balancing iconic songs with new melodies that fit perfectly into the film's tone.

Is there still a love story? YES! The film does not shame ""true love"". It deals with it in a delicate way and honors it. We also get an added layer to the plot, which includes a sort of Cinderella-esque background, with the evil queen controlling those around her. And this leads to another major plot point--Snow White's desire to honor and respect her father's wishes to be a decent and fair leader.
Gal Gadot is marvelous as the evil queen. The sound effects of her movements are crisp and startling, and yes, she is the fairest of them all-for now-- but only on the outside, of course. Her transformation into the ""innocent old lady"" is chilling!

Gal Gadot: It was interesting to see her in a different role but I don't think she should've been picked for this role. I think Anne Hathaway could've done well in this, with an evil comedic take. But, Gal just didn't give the evil queen justice but her songs were nice.

Rachel Zegler: She carried the movie but again the story line wasn't that good, so it took away from her as an actor and her singing wasn't memorable but, knowing her singing in other roles were so much better, leaves me to believe it's Disney's song choices that were bad.

Jonathan: I hated his role, he was like a mixture of Robin hood and Flynn Rider. It would of been nicer if they were to meet in the woods and he was an actual prince. Maybe they could've went on a few forest dates etc.

The dwarfs: I would have liked to see real people play this role, someone pointed out how much angry looks like Tommy Lee Jones and its hard to unsee it. If Disney wanted to take a new route on inclusiveness with these characters, I think it would've been nice to give dopey the use of sign language and maybe snow white some how learned to sign when she was younger and can communicate with him or something along those lines but this was an opportunity to include the Deaf community.

Other factors that contribute to my review is the huge use of cgi. It's so in your face, this is the 1st live action remake that made me feel like I was watching a fairytale and that's not a good thing. With remakes there supposed to bring your favorite characters into the real world while still pulling you into theirs as if their environment could be just as real as they are. Snow white doesn't do that, they also play to heavily on the color contrasting making the whole film bright and artificial. Even the evil queens old hag look was animated, as if she couldn't have had a good make up team to create the look.

Not trying to be funny but the best part of the movie was the end. It was touching to see snow white reconnect with the villagers and the scene where Gadot gets sucked into the mirror was great but the rest not so much.",10.0,2025-03-31,0,51,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0

SUMMARY

A remake of the Disney classic. Cast out from her kingdom by her wicked stepmother queen, a determined princess makes friends in the forest, falling in love, and then goes on a journey to reclaim her castle.

RATING

C

Yikes. You can't really hope for a good film from any of the Disney remakes - which, why can't these films be good? - but this is quite the pinnacle of mediocrity. While I appreciate some of the attempts at modernization (though, at this point this type of ""princesses kicking ass"" actually feels dated), the film is anchored down by misfires all around. Bad acting - from of course, Gal Gadot. Miscast actors - Rachel Zegler is fine, but an innocent, kind, Snow White she is not. Zegler is much more suited to playing a snarky, cynical character than an innocent princess. CGI atrocities. I see we still haven't climbed the Uncanny Valley since The Polar Express.",,2025-03-26,0,3,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0

Her uninspired performance gave a character who is supposed to be joyful an almost bitter, angry and selfish feel to the whole movie.
I understand production companies refuse to bring out new ideas and only want to push movies with an ""ip"" but there is a line where the remakes shouldn't seem like an attack on everything that is wrong with the original. Walt Disney would be rolling over in his grave over this disaster of a movie.",,2025-03-26,0,1,2025-04-11 16:22:26,0
